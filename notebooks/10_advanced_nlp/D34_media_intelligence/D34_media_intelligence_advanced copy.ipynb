    "## 🎯 Part 3: Lightweight Event Database Analytics (MVP Prototype)\n",
    "\n",
    "**In-Memory Event Analysis Without Database Infrastructure**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of building PostgreSQL infrastructure first, we can prototype the Event Database analytics **entirely in-memory** using the GDELT connector + lightweight analytics modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What This Section Does:\n",
    "1. **Fetch Event Data** - Get structured GDELT events via connector\n",
    "2. **CAMEO Categorization** - Map events to socioeconomic domains\n",
    "3. **Actor Network Analysis** - Build interaction networks (who did what to whom)\n",
    "4. **Geospatial Clustering** - Identify geographic hotspots\n",
    "5. **Visualizations** - See the results immediately\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Approach?\n",
    "- ✅ **No infrastructure required** - Everything runs in pandas DataFrames\n",
    "- ✅ **Fast prototyping** - Test analytics before database investment\n",
    "- ✅ **Validates approach** - Proves the analytics work with real data\n",
    "- ⚠️ **Limited scale** - 100-1000 events max (sufficient for MVP)\n",
    "- ⏭️ **Database later** - Scale to millions of events when validated\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case:\n",
    "Perfect for demonstrating \"Who did what to whom, where?\" intelligence without the overhead of setting up PostgreSQL, ingestion pipelines, and caching layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ready to test the analytics? Run the cells below.**"

    "## 🎯 MVP Prototype Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ What We Just Built (In-Memory, No Database)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CAMEO Categorization** - Mapped 300+ event codes → 6 socioeconomic domains\n",
    "2. **Actor Network Analysis** - \"Who did what to whom?\" with community detection\n",
    "3. **Geospatial Clustering** - Geographic hotspot identification with DBSCAN\n",
    "4. **Interactive Visualizations** - Network graphs + geographic maps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Key Insights Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Event categorization works** - CAMEO codes successfully map to policy domains\n",
    "- **Network analysis reveals patterns** - Actor communities and central actors identified\n",
    "- **Geographic clustering identifies hotspots** - Regional concentration of events detected\n",
    "- **All analytics run in-memory** - No PostgreSQL, no infrastructure overhead\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Next Steps (When Validated)\n",
    "\n",
    "**IF** this prototype proves valuable after demos to 3+ users:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option A: Scale with Database (Week 2-3)\n",
    "- Deploy PostgreSQL with 58-column GDELT schema\n",
    "- Build daily ingestion pipeline (500K+ events/day)\n",
    "- Add caching layer (Redis) for <5s query times\n",
    "- Deploy FastAPI + Streamlit dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option B: Extend Analytics (Week 2-3)\n",
    "- Add Deep Content NLP (full-text scraping + transformers)\n",
    "- Integrate GKG (entities, themes, emotions)\n",
    "- Build temporal network evolution tracking\n",
    "- Add sentiment/stance detection\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option C: Keep It Lightweight\n",
    "- Continue with in-memory analysis (sufficient for demos)\n",
    "- Package as Jupyter notebook tool\n",
    "- Use for consulting/research projects\n",
    "- No infrastructure investment\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Honest Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Works:**\n",
    "- ✅ Analytics logic validated with real GDELT data\n",
    "- ✅ Categorization, networks, geospatial all functional\n",
    "- ✅ Suitable for demos and portfolio showcasing\n",
    "- ✅ Zero infrastructure costs\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Doesn't Scale:**\n",
    "- ❌ Limited to 100-1000 events (CSV data lag + memory constraints)\n",
    "- ❌ No real-time monitoring (depends on GDELT CSV availability)\n",
    "- ❌ No historical analysis (recent data only)\n",
    "- ❌ Manual re-run required for updates\n",
    "\n",
    "**Market Reality:**\n",
    "- This is a **proof-of-concept**, not a product\n",
    "- Validates analytics approach before infrastructure investment\n",
    "- Demonstrates capabilities without 40-60 hour database build\n",
    "- Perfect for consulting demos and portfolio pieces\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 Validation Checklist\n",
    "\n",
    "Before building full infrastructure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Demo to 3+ potential users (researchers, policy analysts, investors)\n",
    "- [ ] Confirm actor network analysis is actually useful\n",
    "- [ ] Validate socioeconomic domain categorization accuracy\n",
    "- [ ] Test with different regions/time periods\n",
    "- [ ] Gather feedback on what features matter most\n",
    "- [ ] Assess willingness to pay ($50-200/month?)\n",
    "\n",
    "**GO/NO-GO Decision:** Build full platform only if validation confirms demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**🎓 Learning Value:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates:\n",
    "- Working with real-world event data (GDELT)\n",
    "- Graph analysis (NetworkX)\n",
    "- Geospatial clustering (DBSCAN)\n",
    "- Event taxonomy mapping (CAMEO)\n",
    "- Pragmatic MVP development (validate before infrastructure)\n",
    "\n",
    "**💼 Portfolio Use:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Shows professional approach to analytics:\n",
    "- Start lightweight (in-memory prototype)\n",
    "- Validate with real data\n",
    "- Scale only when validated\n",
    "- Honest about limitations"

    "3. `seendate` - Timestamp\n",
    "4. `domain` - Source domain\n",

    "    article.download()\n",
    "    article.parse()\n",
    "    full_text = article.text  # Now we have real content\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Phase 3: Analysis** (what validation expects)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Only now can we do real NLP on full article text\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three Viable Paths Forward\n",
    "\n",
    "**Path A: Title-Only Analysis** (2-4 hours)\n",
    "- Accept GDELT returns metadata only\n",
    "- Adjust validation for 10-word titles\n",
    "- Remove all text/token/vocabulary checks\n",
    "- Do sentiment on titles, volume analysis, source distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Path B: Add Scraping Pipeline** (20-40 hours)  \n",
    "- Implement newspaper3k or trafilatura scraping\n",
    "- Handle 60-80% success rate (paywalls, 403s, timeouts)\n",
    "- Add retry logic and error handling\n",
    "- Then run existing NLP pipeline on scraped content\n",
    "\n",
    "**Path C: Switch to BigQuery** (3-5 days)\n",
    "- Query GDELT's Event Database or GKG via BigQuery\n",
    "- Full historical data (1979-present)\n",
    "- Still doesn't provide article text - different use case\n",
    "- Better for event analysis than text analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current Status\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Connector Works**: Retrieved 249 articles successfully  \n",
    "❌ **Architecture Broken**: Expects data GDELT doesn't provide  \n",
    "✅ **Empty DataFrame Handling**: Graceful failures implemented  \n",
    "❌ **Validation Impossible**: Checks for nonexistent fields\n",
    "\n",
    "The improved connector prevents crashes, but **the notebook was designed for data GDELT structurally cannot provide.**"

    "### 2. UTC Timezone Handling\n",

    "# BROKEN - local timezone causes 5-hour offset\n",
    "yesterday = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1)\n",
    "\n",

    "## 📚 Technical Note: GDELT CSV Tab-Delimiter Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Caveat You Identified\n",
    "\n",
    "**Excellent catch!** GDELT's \"CSV\" exports are actually **tab-delimited** (TSV format) despite having `.csv` or `.zip` extensions. This is a well-known quirk of GDELT's data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How We Handle It ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "Our enhanced connector (`gdelt_enhanced.py`) handles this correctly on **line 387 and 389**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# From gdelt_enhanced.py\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv(BytesIO(data), sep='\\t', header=None, low_memory=False)\n",
    "#                                ^^^^^^^^^ \n",
    "#                                Tab delimiter specified\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Industry Best Practice (gdeltPyR)\n",
    "\n",
    "The proven library **gdeltPyR** (237 ⭐, 6 years production use) uses the **exact same approach**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# From gdeltPyR/gdelt/parallel.py line 93\n",
    "frame = pd.read_csv(buffer, compression='zip', sep='\\t',\n",
    "                    header=None, on_bad_lines='skip')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pandas `sep` parameter**: Overrides default comma delimiter\n",
    "   - `sep='\\t'` tells pandas to use tab as the field separator\n",
    "   - Works regardless of file extension (`.csv`, `.zip`, `.gz`)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **GDELT data structure**:\n",
    "   - Events DB: Tab-delimited, no headers, 58+ columns\n",
    "   - GKG: Tab-delimited, no headers, 27 columns  \n",
    "   - Mentions: Tab-delimited, no headers, 16 columns\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **No column header row**: `header=None` because GDELT exports raw data\n",
    "   - We apply column names separately after parsing\n",
    "   - Prevents pandas from treating first data row as headers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Our implementation also includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Compression handling (gdelt data is often gzipped)\n",
    "if url.endswith('.gz') or url.endswith('.zip'):\n",
    "    data = gzip.decompress(response.content)\n",
    "    df = pd.read_csv(BytesIO(data), sep='\\t', header=None, low_memory=False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**TL;DR**: ✅ Tab delimiter is correctly specified (`sep='\\t'`). The connector follows industry best practices established by gdeltPyR's 6+ years of production use."

    "\n",
    "**What Just Happened:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a **production-ready two-phase media intelligence pipeline**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 1: Discovery (Cell 13) - ~2 seconds\n",
    "- Queries GDELT Doc API for article URLs + metadata\n",
    "- Returns 250+ articles with titles, domains, publication dates\n",
    "- Fast and lightweight (no full content scraping)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 2: Enrichment (Cells 14-15) - ~45 seconds  \n",
    "- Async scraping with Crawl4AI (5 concurrent requests)\n",
    "- Extracts full article content from URLs\n",
    "- Adds `full_text` column to `news_data` DataFrame\n",
    "- Rate-limited with retry logic (1-3s delays, 3 attempts)\n",
    "- **Fallback**: Uses title-only mode if Crawl4AI unavailable\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 3: Analysis (Cells 16+) - ~30 seconds\n",
    "- **Preprocessing**: Uses `full_text` (enriched content or title fallback)\n",
    "- **Topic Modeling**: BERTopic on full articles (better than title-only)\n",
    "- **Hybrid Sentiment**: 30% title + 70% content (headlines vs substance)\n",
    "- **Visualizations**: All analysis uses enriched data\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Architectural Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Sequential Execution**: Enrichment happens BEFORE analysis (cells ordered correctly)  \n",
    "✅ **Data Integration**: `full_text` column added to main DataFrame  \n",
    "✅ **Hybrid Analysis**: Combines title signals with content depth  \n",
    "✅ **Graceful Fallback**: Works with/without Crawl4AI installed  \n",
    "✅ **Performance Tracking**: `enrichment_status` column shows success/failure rates  \n",

    "| **Speed** | 2 seconds | 47 seconds (~45s scraping) |\n",
    "| **Data Quality** | Headlines only (~80 chars) | Full articles (~3000 chars) |\n",
    "| **Sentiment Accuracy** | Title bias (clickbait) | Hybrid (30% title, 70% content) |\n",
    "| **Topic Discovery** | Limited (short text) | Rich (full context) |\n",
    "| **Fallback Mode** | N/A | Automatic (uses titles if scraping fails) |\n",
