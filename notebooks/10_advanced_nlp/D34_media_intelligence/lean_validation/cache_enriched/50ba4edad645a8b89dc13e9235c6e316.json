(Atlanta News First) - Housing affordability is the top issue in metro Atlanta, followed by traffic woes and safety concerns, according to new survey results by the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC). ARC released its annual Atlanta Speaks Survey, where it polled 4,121 adults across 11 metro Atlanta counties and the City of Atlanta. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s a loaded question. There are so many big issues. Traffic is definitely one of them, if we\u2019re talking about Atlanta. Housing is a huge one,\u201d said Alexia Lewis, an Atlanta resident.Interestingly, 62% of respondents said they would not be able to afford another house or apartment in their current neighborhood. \u201cStop building these luxury apartments that nobody is asking for. Let\u2019s maybe work on the property taxes,\u201d Lewis said.\u201cI think the rent gets higher and higher each year. There needs to be something. I live in the West End, and you can see it all around,\u201d said John, another Atlanta resident.In 2024, the economy was named as the region\u2019s top issue in the same survey. One of the most staggering findings from the annual survey, many people feel things are getting worse. Nearly half (46.5%) of respondents said they expected living conditions in metro Atlanta to be worse in the next 3-4 years, while 16% said they thought things would be better over that time period, according to survey results.In 2024, 33% of respondents said things would be worse off and 28% said they\u2019d be better.The survey was released Friday as part of the State of the Region address in downtown Atlanta, hosted by Atlanta Regional Commission. Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens along with Ed Bastian, CEO of Delta Air Lines, were the featured speakers at the annual event. In the lobby of the Georgia World Congress Center sat a potential solution to address on of Atlanta\u2019s biggest problems. Glydways, an autonomous vehicle company based in the San Francisco Bay area, showcased one of its newest vehicles. In 2026, the company is launching a two-year pilot program adjacent to Atlanta\u2019s airport. The autonomous service will run between the SkyTrain by the Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport and the Georgia International Convention Center/Gateway Arena. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in Atlanta, and this is common to a lot of major metros, is they [Atlanta] have unmet needs on mobility that are not well-served by building a new highway and can\u2019t be well-served by building new rail because it\u2019s so expensive, so can we help,\u201d said Brian Gettinger, senior VP of growth for Glydways.MARTA invested $10 million to fund the project, which is set to start in 2026. The autonomous system could potentially expand into south Fulton and Clayton counties. Gettinger said they\u2019ve also been in early discussions with Mayor Dickens and Beltline officials about expansion long the Beltline\u2019s eastside trail or along the North Avenue corridor between Ponce City Market and Georgia Tech. \u201cReally for us, we see our vision for transit opportunity as not just a pilot at the airport, that\u2019s a start. But where within the Atlanta region are there needs for mobility that can\u2019t be well-served by rail, it\u2019s too expensive, [and] it may not be well-served by bus,\u201d Gettinger said.Copyright 2025 WANF.
