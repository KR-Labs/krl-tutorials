{"full_text": "The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA)\u2019s Purchase Applications Payment Index (PAPI) for October showed that homebuyer affordability improved for the fifth consecutive month, with the national median payment applied for by purchase applicants decreasing to $2,039 \u2014 down from $2,067 in September.\nMBA\u2018s PAPI measures how new monthly mortgage payments vary across time, relative to income, using data from the trade group\u2019s Weekly Applications Survey.\nEdward Seiler, MBA\u2019s associate vice president of housing economics and executive director of the Research Institute for Housing America, said that the streak of improved affordability conditions is tied to lower mortgage rates, higher household earnings and flattening home-price growth.\n\u201cThe median purchase application payment amount in October was $88 lower than one year ago. Affordability is improving \u2014 PAPI is at its lowest level since March 2022\u2014 and is likely to continue to as mortgage rates hold to around 6% and more supply comes onto the market,\u201d Seiler said.\nAn increase in MBA\u2019s PAPI indicates declining borrower affordability conditions, and that the mortgage payment-to-income ratio is higher due to increasing application loan amounts, rising mortgage rates or a decrease in earnings.\nConversely, a decrease in the PAPI indicates improving borrower affordability conditions and occurs when loan application amounts decrease, mortgage rates decrease or earnings increase.\nThe national PAPI fell 1.6% to a reading of 152.0 in October, down from 155.0 in September, reflecting a 4.2% drop in typical mortgage payments. And earnings growth pushed affordability up 5.5% on an annual basis.\nFor borrowers applying for lower-payment mortgages, at the 25th percentile, the national payment fell to $1,402, down from $1,418 the previous month.\nThe national median mortgage payment in October was $2,039, down $28 from September and $88 lower than a year earlier. Federal Housing Administration\u00a0(FHA) borrowers saw their median monthly payment dip slightly to $1,789, compared to $1,792 in September and $1,842 in October 2024.\nConventional loan applicants, meanwhile, reported a median payment of $2,063, down from $2,105 the month prior and $2,134 a year earlier.\nThe states with the highest PAPI readings \u2014 meaning the least affordable markets \u2014 were Idaho (238.0), Nevada (230.7), Rhode Island (199.4), Arizona (198.6) and Tennessee (192.8). The most affordable markets were Louisiana (113.5), Connecticut (116.2), Washington, D.C. (118.6), Hawaii (123.6) and North Dakota (124.9).\nAffordability improved across demographic groups. The PAPI for Black households fell to 151.5 in October, down from 154.4 in September. Hispanic households saw their index score decline from 144.3 to 141.6 during the month, while the reading for white households eased from 156.0 to 153.1.\nRelated\nMore:\nAffordability\nHomebuyers\nMortgage Applications\nMortgage Bankers Association", "extraction_method": "beautifulsoup", "word_count": 432, "success": true}
