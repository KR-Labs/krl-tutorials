Some residents are having a difficult time paying the three rent increases they have received this year in a building where residents say repairs are not being met.\n(Photo by Sarah Reingewirtz, Pasadena Star-News/SCNG)\nBy Jonathan Lansner | jlansner@scng.com | Orange County RegisterPUBLISHED: October 23, 2025 at 7:24 AM PDT | UPDATED: October 24, 2025 at 5:54 PM PDTGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...What\u2019s the biggest cause of high housing costs in the nation?\nIndustry insiders answer that government bureaucracy slows or prevents the construction of new housing, compounded by the public\u2019s \u201cnot-in-my-backyard\u201d aversion to adding homes in their neighborhoods.\nWell, one poll shows the typical American thinks the industry needs to look at itself, too. The Searchlight Institute\u2019s recent poll of 2,123 U.S. adults on housing provides another perspective on the grand affordability debate.\nAlso see:\u00a0Southern California home sales slump to another record low\nThere\u2019s no argument about the scope of the financial burden, as 93% of those polled said housing was overly expensive \u2013 with 43% saying \u201cway too high.\u201d\nBut one question summed up the doubts about the industry\u2019s contention that housing construction is the best cure for affordability.\nThe poll asked: \u201cDo you believe that increasing the number of homes in your community will lower prices or raise prices?\u201d\nThe results showed 44% of those polled saw development as raising prices vs. 24% seeing price declines.\nSome industry insiders and policy wonks will say the public needs a few economics lessons. More supply should lower prices.\nBut what many Americans see is construction that focuses on higher-end residences. To those eyes, that\u2019s increasing their local housing cost.\nThe industry is currently burdened with huge inventories of unsold new houses and empty new apartments, which are offered at what many see as inflated prices. Perhaps those selling homes and leasing rentals should rethink customer concerns about affordability.\nConsider who Americans blamed when the poll sought rankings of affordability roadblocks. Look at what drew the most votes as examples of housing policy\u2019s disconnect.\n#1 Investors\nThe poll found 48% of Americans surveyed cited \u201cinvestors are buying up housing to turn a profit\u201d as a big cause of high housing costs.\nNumerous industry insiders argue that investors are good for the market. Their cash provides liquidity, particularly as buyers when others won\u2019t take the risk.\nCritics say investor cash inflates prices above what many house hunters can afford, essentially squeezing out first-time buyers. Tax breaks for investors give them further advantages in the marketplace.\nAnother poll question details Americans\u2019 unease with \u201cinstitutional\u201d house investors \u2013 a minor but controversial slice of the market.\nWhen asked what would happen to home prices if banks or corporations were banned from homeownership, 36% of those polled said prices would decrease, vs. 22% who thought they\u2019d rise.\n#2 Construction costs\nThe poll found 46% of Americans surveyed cited \u201cmaterials used to build homes are too expensive.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not clear if that\u2019s criticism or a sympathetic answer.\nElsewhere in the results, you see that when asked about barriers to affordability, 67% of those polled cited the focus of landlords and developers on high-profit projects. That\u2019s a dig at the industry\u2019s luxury push.\nBut Americans polled also agree with industry beefs about the costs builders incur.\nNote that 76% of those polled saw construction costs and financing requirements as an affordability barrier, 66% acknowledged the challenges of limited land and infrastructure, and 55% saw shortages of workers and materials as a problem.\n#3 Landlords\nThe poll found 43% of Americans surveyed cited \u201clandlords are raising rents faster than necessary.\u201d\nCosts for tenants have skyrocketed in recent years, and it appears the industry has work to do to explain its pricing and potential solutions.\nConsider the popularity of two fixes: rent control, the industry\u2019s bane, and what developers want: easy construction of more units.\nWhen asked about the impact of tactics to improve affordability, both rent freezes/caps and friendlier apartment zoning received approval from 34% of those polled, seeing the moves as cost-cutters.\nBut 26% fear rising costs from pro-apartment policies \u2013 likely tied to upscale development.\nContrast that to the 19% who saw rent control increasing expenses. Pricing limits can make costs higher for tenants who live in non-regulated units.\n#4 Politicians\nThe poll found that 33% of Americans surveyed cited that \u201celected officials do not prioritize policies to make housing more affordable.\u201d\nSo Americans do sympathize with the industry\u2019s battles to increase housing supply.\nGovernment approvals and community input for projects were seen as an affordability barrier by 61% of those polled, vs. 21% who didn\u2019t see a concern. And zoning and regulation were a barrier to 68% of those surveyed, vs. 17% who didn\u2019t.\nBy the way, a new California law would limit community opposition to mid-rise apartment construction near transit hubs.\nAdditionally, Americans are OK with the industry\u2019s wishes for streamlined project approvals. Faster permitting was popular: 65% approved vs. 17% disapproved.\nJonathan Lansner is the business columnist for the Southern California News Group.
