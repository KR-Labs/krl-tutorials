The population of Charlotte, N.C., nearly doubled, while Montreal\u2019s rose only 23 per cent, yet Montreal\u2019s housing prices climbed far more dramatically.\n\n\nTwenty years of price growth\n\n\n\n\nBetween July, 2005, and July, 2025, Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto recorded the steepest home price increases among large North American metropolitan areas. Notably, Montreal now slightly edges out Toronto in 20-year price growth, owing in part to the recent price correction in the Greater Toronto Area.\nPopulation growth is often seen as the prime driver of housing costs: More people mean more demand, which pushes prices higher. Yet the data reveal otherwise. \nCharlotte, Orlando and Houston posted the fastest population growth over the past 20 years, but their home price appreciation fell well below that of Canadian cities. Orlando, for instance, saw its population grow by 52 per cent \u2013 outpacing Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal \u2013 yet its housing prices increased far less than in those Canadian markets.\n\nSupply and demand imbalances\n\nPopulation growth alone cannot explain Canada\u2019s housing price surge. Instead, persistent imbalances between housing supply and demand dominate.\n\nOn the supply side, restrictive zoning limits new housing, while lengthy approvals and high development fees raise costs. Rising material prices and shortages of skilled labour can also add pressure to final prices.\nOn the demand side, beyond population growth, speculative demand can play a significant role when housing is treated as an investment asset. As with most asset classes, price growth has far outpaced salary increases. Higher salaries and inflows of foreign capital may further tilt the equation by enabling higher bids in competitive markets.\n\nThe role of policy and speculation\n\nAs I noted in an earlier article, overly stimulative monetary policy between 2008 and 2017 added fuel to the fire. Rock-bottom interest rates encouraged speculative buying on top of genuine household demand. \nIn Canada, comparatively low property taxes \u2013 unlike in the United States, where those taxes fund much of the K-12 school system \u2013 reduced the carrying cost of real estate and made it an even more attractive asset. Combined with steady inflows of foreign capital, these factors further reinforced speculative demand. \n\nYet demand pressures alone cannot explain the surge. Cities such as Charlotte, with explosive population growth but far lower price appreciation, highlight the decisive role of supply constraints. Toronto, unconstrained by geography, still saw housing growth limited by zoning restrictions and regulatory barriers.\n\nA convergence of forces\n\nIn the end, immigration-driven population growth has contributed to demand, but its role has been secondary. The affordability crisis stems primarily from stimulative monetary policy that supercharged speculation, paired with municipal and provincial regulations that restricted supply. Inflows of foreign capital and relatively low property tax rates further amplified speculative demand.\nTogether, these factors explain why Canadian metros now rank among the least affordable housing markets in North America. Until policy-makers address the demand distortions and the supply bottlenecks, affordability will remain out of reach.\nHanif Bayat, PhD, is the CEO and founder of WOWA.ca, a Canadian personal finance platform. \nPlease enable JavaScript to view this content.\n\n\nReport an editorial error\nReport a technical issue\nEditorial code of conduct\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated stories\n\n\n\n\n\nHave homes gotten pricier \u2013 or has money lost its value?\n\n\n\n\nThe magic math of Liberal home economics\n\n\n\n\nWhile we fret over a stock bubble, the one in housing has already burst\n\n\n\n\n\nHave homes gotten pricier \u2013 or has money lost its value?\n\n\n\n\nThe magic math of Liberal home economics\n\n\n\n\nWhile we fret over a stock bubble, the one in housing has already burst\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo Deeper\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild your knowledge\nTools & Calculators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwitching mortgage lenders at renewal time?
