It wasn\u2019t easy, he said, but it was doable. \nBut the reality of an affordable city with opportunity for all seems to be slipping away. \nLin and his now-wife have raised their two children in the Beacon Hill neighborhood, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know how they\u2019re going to afford to live here,\u201d he said. His mother, now 86, recently retired and is planning to move to the city. On a fixed income with limited savings, the rental market is looking tough, he said. \n\u201cWe see our city transforming, and not in a good direction on affordability,\u201d said Lin, 48, on a recent morning at The Station coffee shop on Beacon Hill. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to change trajectories, but we do have things that we can do.\u201d\nLin, an assistant attorney at the Seattle city attorney\u2019s office currently on sabbatical, is running for the City Council District 2 seat left open after Tammy Morales stepped down in January, triggering a special election. His challenger is Adonis Ducksworth, communications and policy adviser at the Seattle Department of Transportation. \nDistrict 2 encompasses Beacon Hill, Chinatown International District, Columbia City, Rainier Beach and Seward Park. It is the city\u2019s most racially diverse district and among its most economically mixed.\n \nAdvertising \n \n\n\n   \n \n \n \n\n \nSources: Esri, Seattle Redistricting Commission (Mark Nowlin / The Seattle Times) \nTackling housing affordability, and the issues surrounding it like homelessness and public safety, are central to Lin\u2019s campaign. To promote a flourishing community, Seattle and Washington state must increase taxes on big businesses and wealthy residents, he said, while reducing the financial burden on working families and low-income households. \nMost of his work at the Seattle city attorney\u2019s office has been with the city\u2019s Office of Housing, where he implemented policies related to affordable housing, new development and anti-displacement. \nHe helped negotiate the transfer of surplus property from Sound Transit and the University of Washington to the city for affordable housing construction in South Seattle, and shepherded the Four Amigos affordable housing project in Columbia City.  \n\u201cI bring that skill set of understanding housing finance, understanding our regulations,\u201d Lin said.  \nHis experience and priorities appear to have resonated \u2014 in the Aug. 5 primary, Lin received about 47% of the vote, while his challenger Ducksworth received about 29%. But Lin, whose public service work remains relatively unknown to many, continues to hit the pavement and meet voters.\nMoving to Seattle \nLin grew up in North Carolina and Massachusetts, before moving to Minnesota to attend Macalester College where he met his wife. \n \nAdvertising \n \n   \nShe graduated, but Lin had yet to finish school, having struggled with some mental health challenges. Ready to leave the Midwest, they road tripped across the West Coast before settling in Seattle in the late 1990s.\nHis wife taught reading at Dunlap Elementary as an AmeriCorps tutor, and Lin picked up odd jobs. Renting an apartment in Interbay, Lin completed his credits and graduated, while his wife earned a master\u2019s degree at the University of Washington in 2001.\nThe couple moved to Oakland, Calif., where Lin got a job as a receptionist at a law firm and his wife became a teacher and active member of her union. Lin later joined a San Francisco firm that represented labor groups and championed progressive causes around living wages and voting rights, inspiring him to go to law school.   \n\n\u201cIt was just very exciting for me to see attorneys doing this very impactful work,\u201d Lin said. \nThey returned to Seattle, and Lin went on to work as an attorney at Perkins Coie. But in the back of his mind, Lin said, he wanted to do something more community service oriented, a feeling that grew stronger when President Donald Trump was elected in 2016. \nHousing affordability\nLong term, the city needs more dense, walkable neighborhoods with good public transit, Lin said. \n \nAdvertising \n \n\n\n   \n\u201cThat\u2019s how we\u2019re going to address this multitude of issues around affordability, around climate change, around resilience, around public safety,\u201d Lin said.\nThe city needs to make it easier and cheaper to build all housing types, he said. Seattle\u2019s growth plan should have included more neighborhood centers, he said, and eliminated parking minimums.\nLin said he supports broader renter protections, such as the recently passed statewide cap on annual rent increases. He also wants to increase city dollars to help keep affordable housing developers and nonprofit groups up and running. \n \n \nMost Read Local Stories \n \n Sea-Tac flights make refueling stops; no timeline to fix pipeline leak   \n South Park residents endure recurring sulfur, \u2018rotten egg\u2019 smell   \n Thanksgiving week travel: WA passes to get heaping servings of snow   \n What really led Trump to threaten Seattle\u2019s World Cup   \n Seattle-area Thanksgiving traffic: The best and worst times to drive     \nStephanie Velasco, a city planning educator who\u2019s worked with Lin, said he is adept at navigating complicated issues. She pointed to his work in implementing the city\u2019s \u201ccommunity preference\u201d housing policy, which encourages city-funded housing projects to consider neighborhood ties when selecting occupants.\n\u201cAs the lawyer in the room \u2026 he could\u2019ve really easily said, \u2018No, there\u2019s too much risk,\u2019 \u201d Velasco said.\nInstead, Lin helped ensure the policy was shielded from the lawsuits other cities saw over similar efforts, but remained an effective tool to promote racial equity, Velasco said. \n \n \n \n \nSponsored  \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n      \nHomelessness\nFor too long, District 2 has been the primary victim of Seattle\u2019s failure to address homelessness, said Sharon Maeda, a longtime activist in South Seattle and former journalist, referencing Little Saigon and ongoing public safety issues there.  \nMaeda said she\u2019s been disappointed before by candidates, but Lin impressed her with his understanding of what\u2019s working \u2014 and what\u2019s not. \n\u201cYou can\u2019t do it overnight, and what I appreciate about Eddie the most is he really is a thoughtful thinker, and he knows how to pull pieces together,\u201d she said. \n\nLin does not support the mayor\u2019s effort to increase encampment removals, saying it\u2019s a costly policy that traumatizes and pushes people around while failing to address root causes of homelessness. \nThe city needs to increase its behavioral health services and drug treatment capacity, build more low-barrier shelters and fund more supportive housing, Lin said. \nPublic safety\nOn a recent weekend of doorknocking, Lin came across Ronald Cabang at his childhood home, helping his parents fry lumpia in the garage. When Lin asked Cabang what city officials should prioritize, the answer was quick. \n \nAdvertising \n \n   \nJust last week, Cabang said, someone snatched his mother\u2019s necklace right off her neck as she was gardening. She didn\u2019t report the incident to police.\n\u201cHer English isn\u2019t really good, so they don\u2019t really communicate with police officers,\u201d Cabang said. \u201cThey feel like they just have to deal with things but at the same time I can\u2019t do anything either.\u201d\nStories like that are part of why Lin supports hiring more police officers, he said, with a focus on hiring diverse officers who speak different languages. He also wants to beef up youth programs to reduce gun violence and delinquency. \nLin said the city should invest more in its CARE department, the nonemergency police alternative. The Seattle Police Department overall, he said, is in need of greater accountability and civilian oversight. \nProgressive revenue \nLin is a staunch critic of the state\u2019s regressive tax code, which forces the city\u2019s poorest residents to contribute a greater share of their income toward taxes than wealthier neighbors. As a council member, Lin said he would work with state lawmakers to advocate for a state income tax. \nHe would like to see a local capital gains tax or a higher rate for the city\u2019s existing JumpStart tax initiative, a payroll tax on large businesses with high-earning employees intended to fund affordable housing. \n\u201cWe\u2019re never going to be able to meet the needs of our community without fixing our upside down tax code,\u201d Lin said. \n \n \n Alexandra Yoon-Hendricks: 206-464-2246 or ayoonhendricks@seattletimes.com.
