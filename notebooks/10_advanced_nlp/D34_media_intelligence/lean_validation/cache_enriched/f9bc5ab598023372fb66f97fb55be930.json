(KSNV)\n\n\nHe noted that jobs in the area are not keeping pace with rising housing costs, making homeownership \"simply out of reach for most of the jobs in this town.\" Irwin highlighted that a minimum wage worker now faces an \"impossible number of hours\" to afford a home, a situation exacerbated by pressures from West Coast housing markets. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere does Las Vegas stack up? (KSNV)\n\n\nDespite Southern Nevada being one of the more affordable regions in the West, the influx of people from California is driving up demand without a corresponding increase in supply. \n\n\n\nIncomes among hospitality jobs (KSNV)\n\n\n\"We are not building houses at the rate we used to,\" Irwin said, citing permitting, zoning, and federal land ownership issues as contributing factors. He warned that Las Vegas is nearing the unaffordability levels seen in California, which poses a significant challenge. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLas Vegas: In Perspective (KSNV)\n\n\nFor prospective homebuyers, Irwin advised, \"It is just a matter of sometimes just getting lucky. Maybe buying a slightly smaller house with a smaller payment and hoping you can upgrade in the future.\" However, he acknowledged that \"getting in is the tough part\" as entry prices continue to rise while wages lag behind.\n\n\n\nFannie Mae raises mortgage rate forecast amid tariff uncertainty (AP Photo/Jenny Kane)\n\n\nREAD THE COMMENTS (5)\nTo read the Lied Center for Real Estate report, click here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n\nAnother milestone reached in Athletics ballpark construction in Las Vegas\nA's team owner John Fisher and other dignitaries held a ceremonial groundbreaking for the ballpark back in June.\n\nPolice release body cam video of road-rage shooting that killed 11-year-old\nThe Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department has released body-camera videos showing the aftermath of a road-rage shooting that resulted in the death of 11-year\n\nLocal attorney shares why stepfather wasn't charged in 11-year-old boy'sroad rage death\nThe community is demanding answers after an 11-year-old boy was shot and killed in a road rage incident in Henderson.The suspect , 22-year-old Tyler Matthew Joh\n\n\n\n\n\nNevadans reveal top three independent butchers for quality Thanksgiving turkeys\nAs Thanksgiving approaches, Nevadans have named their top three independent butchers in a recent poll conducted by MarketBeat, a financial media company.The su\n\nPedestrian dies after crash near Nellis, Sahara in east Las Vegas\nA man is dead after he was hit by a car while crossing a street in east Las Vegas on Sunday, according to police.The collision happened just after 5:50 p.m. on \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEWS IN PHOTOS:\"Local\"\n\n\n3\nFamily of woman killed in 12-car crash hold fundraiser to help with funeral costs\n\n4\nFlamingo Las Vegas gears up for milestone anniversary with new hotel, casino renovations\n\n3\nAces' Gray, Young lined up for Team USA training camp\n\n3\nNevada lawmakers want new hearings in Congress for potential nuclear testing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACCESSIBILITY\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerms & Conditions\nCopyright Notices\nEEO Public File Report\nPublic Inspection File\nFCC Applications\nPublic Inspection File Assistance\nContact Us\nContests\n\n\nNews\nWeather\nTraffic\nSports\nStation\nPolitics\nAround the Web\nGame Center\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nDo Not Sell or Share\n\nCookie Preferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2025 Sinclair, Inc.", "extraction_method": "jina", "word_count": 1649, "success": true}
