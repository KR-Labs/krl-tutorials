That\u2019s up 105.8% from before the pandemic, when rural buyers needed to earn $36,206, according to a new report from Redfin, the real estate brokerage powered by Rocket.\nBy comparison, the income needed to afford a home in suburban counties has risen 90.9% (to $102,120 from $53,482), and the income needed to afford a home in urban counties has climbed 87.5% (to $118,300 from $63,103). Rural America has been hit by a one-two punch of rising home prices and lagging incomes, and as a result has seen housing affordability erode faster than big cities and suburbs.\nThis is based on a Redfin analysis that compares the third quarter of 2025 with the third quarter of 2019. Redfin considers a home affordable if a buyer taking out a mortgage spends no more than 30% of their income on their monthly housing payment. The analysis uses MLS median home sale price data, prevailing mortgage rates and property-tax payments, and U.S. Census Bureau data on incomes.\nHomebuyers in rural areas have faced relatively large jumps in home prices, which is one reason affordability has eroded. The median sale price in rural counties is $280,900, up 60.5% from $175,000 before the pandemic. By comparison, suburban counties have seen a 48.9% increase (to $385,000 from $258,500) and urban counties have experienced a 46.2% gain (to $446,000 from $305,000).\nIncome growth also hasn\u2019t kept up. The median household income in rural counties is $69,307, up 33.3% from $52,002 before the pandemic. By comparison, suburban counties have seen a 36.8% gain (to $88,627 from $64,782) and urban counties have seen a 39.3% gain (to $89,784 from $64,468).\nBig cities fell out of favor during the pandemic, when scores of Americans moved to rural and suburban areas in search of space, privacy and access to nature. Some were seeking a lower cost of living, while others were buying up pricey vacation homes in places like Lake Tahoe. Record-low mortgage rates and remote work were the forces that empowered millions to relocate. The pandemic homebuying frenzy that swept through rural and suburban areas sent home prices soaring, leaving many communities grappling with an affordability crisis that persists today. Rural areas often only have a handful of homes for sale, meaning homebuyers frequently compete with one another\u2014another factor that drives up prices.\n\u201cDuring the pandemic, many buyers came to New Hampshire from out of state\u2014places like New York, Texas, California, and Seattle. They often had larger budgets than locals and were able to pay above the asking price, which helped them win bidding wars and purchase properties in the Lakes Region,\u201d said Julia Martinage, a Redfin Premier real estate agent in New Hampshire. \u201cA lot of those people are now moving back to where they came from and being replaced by locals or people from border states like Massachusetts. I\u2019m seeing a lot of young couples and families moving to rural areas from cities like Nashua and Manchester. They want land, chickens, quiet\u2014a better quality of life.\u201d\nRural Areas Continue to Attract Homebuyers Because They Remain Relatively Affordable\nWhile rural areas have seen the fastest uptick in home prices in recent years, they remain affordable compared to many suburban and urban areas\u2014one reason people continue to move to rural America.\nA household on the median income in rural counties would need to spend 32.3% of their earnings on housing to buy the median-priced home. While that\u2019s up from 20.9% before the pandemic, it remains lower than the share in suburban and urban areas. In suburban counties, a household on the median income would need to spend 34.6% of their income to buy the typical home, and in urban counties, it would need to spend 39.5%.\nA rule of thumb in personal finance is to spend no more than 30% of income on housing, but that has become less realistic as housing costs have climbed.\n\u201cRural America isn\u2019t as affordable as it once was, but the silver lining is that unlike many urban areas, there\u2019s still room to build homes,\u201d said Redfin Senior Economist Asad Khan. \u201cAdding more housing can ease the affordability crunch and also make room for more people, which can boost local economies.\u201d\nGovernments in some states are actively seeking to combat the rural housing shortage through building. New York, for example, just invested $50 million in a program that will build manufactured housing, which is typically cheaper and quicker to construct.\nNew Hampshire Has Seen the Biggest Increase in Income Needed to Afford a Rural Home\nHomebuyers need to earn an annual income of $119,361 to afford the median-priced home in rural New Hampshire. That\u2019s up 141.4% from before the pandemic\u2014a bigger increase than rural areas in any other state Redfin analyzed. It\u2019s followed by neighboring Vermont and Maine, which saw respective increases of 139.2% and 137.3%.\nThese states top the list because they\u2019ve seen the largest increases in home prices. The median rural home sale price in New Hampshire is up 88.3% from before the pandemic\u2014a bigger increase than any other state Redfin analyzed. Next came Vermont and Maine, with respective increases of 86.6% and 85.1%.\nTo view the full report, including charts and additional state-level data, please visit: https://www.redfin.com/news/suburban-urban-rural-q3-2025\nAbout Redfin\nRedfin is a technology-driven real estate company with the country's most-visited real estate brokerage website.
