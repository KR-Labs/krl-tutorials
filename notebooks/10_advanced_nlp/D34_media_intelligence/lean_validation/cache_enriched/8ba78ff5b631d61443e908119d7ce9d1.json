And so they think, \u2018Oh, we can come here and get a very nice home for a lot less, and many of them are allowed to still do remote work,\u201d she told The Business Journal.\nDyer also noted that Fresno\u2019s proximity, lifestyle and affordability have fueled migration, but high energy costs don\u2019t help some of the issues.\n\u201cEnergy rates here in Fresno, in the Valley, are 80% higher than anywhere else in the nation,\u201d he said, adding that PG&E rates have risen over 50% in recent years.\nEarlier this year, at the Fresno County Economic Development Corp. real estate forecast, Dyer had a discussion with PG&E CEO Patti Poppe regarding infrastructure improvements, partnerships and ongoing efforts to rebuild trust with Fresno residents and officials.\n\u201cOne of the biggest drivers of our bills going up was the need to harden our system to wildfire and other extreme weather, not just wildfire, but extreme rains, extreme winds, extreme snow up in the Sierras,\u201d Poppe said in an interview with The Business Journal following the event. \u201cWe are building infrastructure, transforming our infrastructure so it\u2019s fit for purpose. It\u2019s an important investment to make, but that investment will have returns over decades to come while we continue to reduce the cost to maintain that equipment every single year.\u201d\nDyer touched on Fresno\u2019s increased efforts to address the housing crisis through the One Fresno Housing Strategy, which includes 47 action-oriented initiatives\n\u201cWe\u2019re almost done with all 47 strategies,\u201d he said, noting a 144% increase in affordable housing units planned for 2026 compared to prior years.\nHowever, he stressed the need for balance, noting the need for market-rate housing in addition to affordable housing.\n\u201cAffordable housing doesn\u2019t pay the bills. We don\u2019t get property tax from it. We have to have market-rate housing,\u201d Dyer said, advocating for policies that support homeownership as \u201cthe best form of rent stabilization.\u201d\nCarol Ornelas, president and CEO of Visionary Home Builders of California, noted the rising costs of construction and insurance as major hurdles.\n\u201cOne of the biggest things today that\u2019s affecting [housing] is, how much does insurance cost?\u201d Ornelas said, noting that course-of-construction insurance has surged from $300,000 to $1 million for a two-year period due to fire risks and other factors.\nShe also highlighted labor shortages and tariffs as challenges, stating the need for community engagement, while giving a call to action to Realtors and community members.\n\u201cWe need everybody in this room to get on a table when it\u2019s talking about your community and your needs, because the Central Valley\u2019s been pretty well neglected for a very long time,\u201d she said.\nBernadette Austin, CEO of Civic Well, a Sacramento-based nonprofit that works with community leaders on sustainability, pointed to the economic and demographic shifts driving housing pressures.\nA research project she led found that post-pandemic migration to the Central Valley was driven not only by affordability but also by housing stock availability.\n\u201cPeople were moving\u2026 because they needed more affordable housing\u2026 [but also for] the availability of housing stock. How big were the homes? Were their kids able to have their own bedrooms?\u201d Austin said.\nRelated Posts\nTiger Woods\u2019 official golf simulator coming to Tachi Palace\nPosted: November 24, 2025 at 5:23 pm\nThe official golf simulator of legend Tiger Woods will soonRead more \u00bb\nReport: California dairy drives $23.2B in economic impact\nPosted:\nat 5:05 pm\nCalifornia's dairy industry contributed $23.2 billion to the state's grossRead more \u00bb\nTynergy\u2019s Fresno Future?
