The majority of housing starts in Ottawa are rental apartments, followed by rowhouses and single-family homes, according to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation data.Article contentThe Evening CitizenThe Ottawa Citizen\u2019s best journalism, delivered directly to your inbox by 7 p.m. on weekdays.There was an error, please provide a valid email address.Sign UpBy signing up you consent to receive the above newsletter from Postmedia Network Inc.Thanks for signing up!A welcome email is on its way.

Giving more attention to supply would have been much more welcome. Ultimately, that\u2019s the biggest problem that we\u2019re still facing.Article content\u201cWe need to provide people with lateral movement (in the housing market) into their first home and fill in that missing middle.\u201dArticle contentArticle contentCzan\u2019s comments came after Finance Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne tabled Budget 2025 on Nov. 4.Article contentRead More\nIndigenous veterans' sacrifices at home and abroad recognized in Ottawa-area ceremony\nMcDonald's appears ready for ByWard Market return Advertisement 1Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article contentThe budget proposed $51 billion in funding over 10 years for the Build Communities Strong Fund.

I\u2019m looking forward to seeing the details on exactly where that will happen,\u201d Sutcliffe said at a news conference following the tabling of the budget.Article content\u201cI\u2019ve had several conversations with the prime minister and with members of his cabinet about the unique opportunities we have in Ottawa to invest in housing, to use federal land to build housing. There\u2019s lots of opportunity there.\u201dArticle contentBut Czan said the Build Canada Homes initiative wasn\u2019t enough to solve the affordable housing crisis in Ottawa because it was too focused on non-market rental units.Article contentArticle contentThere needs to be a mix of non-market rental units and affordable homes for first-time homebuyers, he added. The removal of the GST for first-time homebuyers\u2019 purchase of a new build under $1 million is a step in the right direction, he said, but it needs to be coupled with supply-oriented solutions.Article content\u201cIf you look at what has been built in all the major cities in Canada over the last five years, it\u2019s been a lot of non-market housing. Being able to provide the supply that\u2019s needed in the market housing category would definitely lead to higher homeownership rates and communities filled with people that are owning their properties,\u201d Czan said.Article contentThe federal budget is expected to go to a vote in the House of Commons on Nov. 17.Article contentFamilies struggling to find affordable homes: reportArticle contentCzan\u2019s analysis also comes as Ottawa families are struggling to find homes they can afford.Article contentArticle contentAccording to a recent survey conducted by Abacus Data for OREB, 82 per cent of Ottawa residents are concerned about the city\u2019s housing situation. Around 67 per cent of those surveyed said local housing was unaffordable, and 50 per cent said they doubted they would ever be able to afford to buy homes in their communities of choice.Article contentSixty-two per cent of respondents also said they were worried that they could lose their homes or rental units if their financial situations suddenly changed.Article contentIt\u2019s not just renters and aspiring homebuyers feeling the pinch.Article contentData from the city\u2019s 2024 Housing Needs Assessment also suggested that thousands of homeowners were experiencing heightened vulnerability in the housing market due to soaring mortgage rates and costs. The proportion of homeowners in Ottawa paying $2,000 or more per month for housing costs nearly tripled from 2006 to 2021 (from 11.5 per cent to 34.2 per cent).Article contentMeanwhile, the percentage of homeowners paying between $1,500 and $1,999 per month dipped from 20.4 per cent in 2006 to 17.8 per cent in 2021.Article content\u201cFamilies are being priced out,\u201d Czan said.Article contentThere may be some relief coming in the future. A report by the CMHC in July suggested that Ottawa saw an annual increase in average advertised rent prices, but at a slower pace.Article contentAccording to the City of Ottawa\u2019s housing approvals dashboard, 13,662 housing starts were reported between the first quarter of 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2024.Article contentThe CMHC also said 9,000 rental apartments were currently under construction in Ottawa, setting a record for the city.Article contentThe sheer amount of housing approvals, along with slower population growth, will cause rental prices to fall in the future.Article contentBut Czan said more collaboration needed to happen between all levels of government to address the housing affordability crisis and reduce barriers to buying a home.Article contentArticle content\u201cCollaboration amongst all levels of government would be something that would be positively viewed by our association and many other associations in real estate,\u201d he said.Article content\u201cAny measures that could help fill the gap in terms of missing middle housing would definitely be a welcome move for our marketplace.\u201dArticle contentHe said, for example, the City of Ottawa should remove development charges because they were a roadblock for developers wanting to build more housing. This leads to lower housing starts in any given year.Article content\u201cRemoving those barriers and removing any startup costs and any costs that prevent a barrier to entry ultimately would lead to much more supply being in the market. Ultimately, those costs that are put onto the builder end up getting filtered over to the consumer side of things,\u201d Czan said.Article contentHe also said the city, province and federal governments could work together to provide developers with incentives to build more missing middle housing, especially since officials from all three levels of government were reviewing their financial plans for the next year.Article content\u201cHaving a focus on those low-rise apartments and medium-density housing units would definitely be a welcome thing that should be considered in the (city, provincial and federal) budgets,\u201d Czan said.Article contentOur website is your destination for up-to-the-minute news, so make sure to bookmark our homepage and sign up for our newsletters\u00a0so we can keep you informed.Article contentShare this article in your social network\nShare this Story : Federal budget falls short in addressing housing affordability in Ottawa: real estate board\nCopy Link\nEmail\nX\nReddit\nPinterest\nLinkedIn\nTumblr CommentsYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.Create an AccountSign in\nJoin the Conversation Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.
