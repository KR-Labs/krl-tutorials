Councilmembers hold a joint committee oversight roundtable on the District's housing voucher program on November 13, 2025.

Housing AuthorityDepartment of Human ServicesHousing assistanceHomelessnessLease-upsWASHINGTON, D.C. (7News) \u2014 Members of the D.C. Council held a public oversight roundtable on Wednesday to discuss the District's housing voucher programs.The District's locally-funded system provides housing vouchers to residents in need to help them pay rent through two programs: Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) and Targeted Affordable Housing (TAH). PSH provides a housing subsidy and supportive services to individuals and\nfamilies exiting homelessness, while TAH\nis intended for households who need assistance obtaining and affording housing -- most likely due to advanced age\nand/or disability.Councilmember Robert C. White, Jr., Chair of the Committee on Housing, and Councilmember Matthew Frumin, Chairperson of the Committee on Human Services, convened the roundtable, which provided oversight on the D.C. Housing Authority (DCHA) and the Department of Human Services (DHS). RELATED | DC property management company sued over housing voucher abuseLast fiscal year, the average wait length from voucher approval to lease approval was 205 days, according to DHS. That's down from 421 days in fiscal year 2023. Those wait times don't include the initial application process to determine eligibility.\"In the past two years, we've cut in half the times it's taking the city to get people from homelessness into housing, but we need to continue to do better,\" White told 7News. \"It's still over 200 days. So I like the progress, but I don't want to let this up.\"I want to make sure we have our agencies, our nonprofit partners and the people who actually use vouchers and those who rent to them all in the same place, so that nobody's pointing fingers. So we keep pulling everybody to the same table, saying: 'Let's do better.'\"More than 45 people signed up to testify, including members of the public and government representatives.At previous oversight hearings on this topic, a number of residents called out how slow the process has been to receive housing assistance. Those concerns were echoed Thursday.\u201cThe importance of the improving this, the speed of the voucher process, cannot be overstated,\" Andy Wassenich, policy director for the nonprofit Miriam's Kitchen, testified. \"The positive benefits of making it better are far reaching.\u201dMultiple advocates told councilmembers that better streamlining the multiple steps involved to secure housing can help make for shorter wait times. \"Any little delay in the process just adds length of time,\" Jill Coppick, a PSH manager at Everyone Home DC, told 7News. She said the delays her team is seeing are even higher than the District-wide average, reporting an average 288 days to get housing secured for eligible individuals and an average 471 days for families. Coppick told 7News the president\u2019s executive order aimed at removing homeless encampments in the District further spotlights the issue of getting the homeless into homes more quickly.\"When they're getting moved around, the encampments are changing,\" she explained. \"It can delay the process in terms of trying to locate people.\"Several voucher recipients spoke about being discriminated against throughout the process, from landlords not wanting to rent to them to communication issues with case managers. \u201cI'm a human, human just like all of you,\" Deaundra Johnson testified. \"I got a voucher, that is it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard the testimony, I\u2019ve heard the frustration,\" DCHA Executive Director Keith Pettigrew told councilmembers. \"We know some people haven\u2019t been treated as they should\u2019ve and we\u2019re working on that.\u201dDHS Acting Director A.D. Rachel Pierre told councilmembers their goal is to help people access housing within 120 days of being assigned to a case manager, saying they continue to reduce the time it takes to submit a rental application once someone is matched to a case manager.TrendingMan found naked, unconscious after Fairfax County fight later dies: PoliceFairfax County police are investigating a deadly incident after officers responded to a fight early Monday morning.
