Muskegon Ave. The forum-style debate was hosted by Muskegon Engaged, a local organization seeking to inform the public on political happenings. Maggie Doyle, one of the organization\u2019s founders, and John Horne, a local high school government teacher, served as moderators.Johnson, who was first elected mayor in 2021, is running for a second four-year term on the Nov. 4 ballot. Garrettson, his opponent, is a financial planner and U.S. Navy veteran who moved to Muskegon in 2019.The mayoral race was narrowed down to Johnson and Garretson after the two were declared the top vote-getters in the August primary. Johnson came in first place with 2,043 votes, and Garretson placed second with 1,011 votes.Johnson and Garretson on Sunday evening debated a range of local and national topics, including housing, economic development and how city leaders should respond to federal issues like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).On the subject of development in the wake of the $80 million cleanup of Muskegon Lake, candidates were asked how they would ensure growth benefits longtime residents and doesn\u2019t push them out.Garretson said his campaign commitment, \u201chousing for all,\u201d includes all levels from low income to luxury lakefront housing, but his primary focus is on middle-income housing.\u201cWe need to make sure that the residents that live in our downtown areas are also getting help to stay in place and age in place,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also would free up housing that is appropriate for new homeowners.\u201d Johnson said, while high-income housing is vital to the city\u2019s tax base, it is important that Muskegon\u2019s waterfront economy does not become monopolized by the ultra-wealthy.\u201cWe hear sometimes it\u2019s too focused on low-income housing, that there\u2019s too much of it, and that people who can\u2019t afford to live here will just move east,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s ridiculous. We need to make sure our community is welcoming for everyone regardless of economic backgrounds.\u201dWhen asked how they will strengthen the year-round economy while ensuring affordability for residents, Johnson pointed to the pay-to-park program at Pere Marquette Park, which the city uses to generate revenue for the overall parks system.With tourism, Johnson said he embraces it, but doesn\u2019t want Muskegon to be a tourism-dominated economy. \u201cManufacturing has been a critical core of our economy for decades, and while it\u2019s no longer at the height it was a century ago, it is still important,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to make sure that we support our manufacturers and ensure there is a future for them, because manufacturing is how we import wealth into our community.\u201dJohnson also touted an effort he was a part of during his tenure on the city commission to halt development of the dunes at Pere Marquette.When asked how he would attract outside investment while ensuring local businesses are not left behind, Garretson said the best way for Muskegon to continue economic development is by keeping what it has. We lost large numbers of jobs from our employers, and why that happens is because we don\u2019t have relationships with them,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I talked to the largest employer in the city, they\u2019ve never spoken to the city about healthcare or employment issues.\u201dGarretson recommended partnering with cities like Norton Shores and Grand Rapids that are having a \u201cresurgence in economic development.\u201dWhen asked about their response to ICE enforcement and occupation style policing coming from the Trump administration, Garretson said upholding the safety and civil rights of the community is not enough.\u201cWe have a Latino population that\u2019s doubled in the last 15 years,\u201d he said. \u201cWithout that growth, we would have shrunk in our total population, but in many ways they don\u2019t feel like they belong.\u201dTo remedy this, Garretson proposed bilingual services for businesses or people who have been victims of violent crime or people who need mental health services.In response to the same question, Johnson said communities in Muskegon have \u201cvery real fears about the march toward authoritarianism in this country.\u201d\u201cMembers of our community feel dejected, discriminated against and in jeopardy for their lives and that requires a coordinated response,\u201d he said.Johnson pledged his city will not do the work of ICE in Muskegon, notably because notably because it already lacks the resources.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we are going to ignore the law if there is a judicial warrant,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not going to do the federal government\u2019s work for them in regard to ICE enforcement.\u201dJohnson further denounced the federal deployment of troops in Chicago and Portland as \u201cabhorrent,\u201d and proposed Muskegon partner with nearby cities so \u201cwe are not left alone to deal with the federal government and all that entails.\u201dLater in the debate, the topic turned to a Nov. 4 ballot initiative to impose a 12-year term limit on members of the city commission.Johnson, who previously served eight years on the city commission, may be ineligible to serve if the charter amendment is enacted. While he fully expects to serve again as mayor if elected, he warned the amendment could lead to a lengthy legal battle if also passed.Garretson said plainly that he believes Muskegon should listen to the voters. Johnson, however, noted Muskegon has a fresh and young city commission, as well as a history of turning out longtime incumbents.Candidates for city commission also took the stage Sunday night to debate one another prior to the November election. Four candidates competing for two at-large seats, including Commissioner At Large Rebecca St. Clair, Teresa Emory, Kiley N. Jackson and John C. Allen. Emory did not attend Sunday\u2019s debate forum.The candidates in attendance debated a range of topics, including housing affordability, equitable investment in infrastructure and maintaining public land.Ehren WynderEhren Wynder is a business and development reporter at MLive.com covering Ottawa and Muskegon counties. ewynder@mlive.com", "extraction_method": "beautifulsoup", "word_count": 1018, "success": true}
