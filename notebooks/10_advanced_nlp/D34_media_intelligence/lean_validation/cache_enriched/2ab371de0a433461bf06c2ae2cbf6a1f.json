{"full_text": "A new HousingWire Data deep-dive confirms widening affordability gaps and rising inventory in previously constrained markets \u2014 as well as strong regional patterns that favor the South for balance and the Midwest for price relief.\nPittsburgh continues to stand out as the nation\u2019s most affordable major metro, with a median list price of $240,000. Its price-per-square-foot of $167.55 also positions it well below national averages.\nDespite that affordability, the market is far from sluggish.\nPittsburgh posts a 35.5 Market Action Index (MAI), placing it in seller-leaning territory as the market carries just 2.5 months of inventory.\nMAI is HousingWire Data\u2019s proprietary measure of market heat that ranges from 0\u2013100 and gauges the balance between supply and demand.\nDeb Reddick, a Realtor at Pittsburgh-based REMAX 360 Realty, noted that demand is supported not just by low prices, but by strong fundamentals in the region.\n\u201cOne of the reasons people move here is we have excellent medical facilities, that makes people want to be here and it makes them feel like they\u2019re in good hands,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not seeing prices climb as high here as other places, and it\u2019s hard to point to one or a few reasons why that is.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of building and improvement lately, too. The roads make it so if you live just outside of downtown, it\u2019s not hard to get in. It\u2019s all tied together nicely.\u201d\nThe metro also reports a strong 10.2% weekly absorption rate \u2014 the highest among key metros reviewed \u2014 and a 4.4% year-over-year price gain, signaling healthy and sustainable appreciation.\nHomes average 63 days on market, and nearly half of active listings take price cuts, yet sellers still maintain leverage due to tight supply.\nReddick adds that Pittsburgh\u2019s growth has remained measured in part because home values started from a lower base.\n\u201cWell, I think, honestly, they were lower to begin with, and with them climbing they\u2019re not keeping in line with the other cities,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve also had a lot of new building and construction \u2014 a lot of new high rises and condos.\u201d\nAustin\u2019s inventory surge\nAustin, Texas, once among the most supply-constrained markets in the country, now posts one of the strongest inventory totals in the analysis with 10,867 active listings.\nWith 505 new listings added each week, Austin\u2019s supply pipeline remains robust.\nInventory is up 19.1% year-over-year \u2014 the sharpest increase among major metros.\nDespite a recent 5.1% price dip, the market operates at a balanced MAI of 33.1, suggesting buyers have more choice than they did during the pandemic boom but still face competitive conditions.\nMatt Menard, broker-owner at ERA Real Estate Experts in Austin, notes how stark the shift has been from pandemic-era scarcity\n\u201cWe were certainly one of the hottest markets in the country during COVID, and during that period of time, we had an inordinate amount of growth and appreciation,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a time when our inventory levels were about a half a month or less, and then now we\u2019re pushing five months of inventory and 80-plus days on the market.\u201d\nHomes average 84 days on market and price-per-square-foot sits at $225.03.\nMenard emphasized that despite the cooling, the market remains active and offers opportunity.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still seeing a relatively good sales pace,\u201d he said. \u201cInventory is just hanging out there. The number of sales are still relatively strong. We\u2019re just seeing properties take a little bit longer to sell, and I think for buyers, it represents an incredible environment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a chance to buy when the market is much more forgiving. I\u2019m telling buyers that it\u2019s kind of like a Black Friday sale this quarter, and people are going to look back in a year or two and wish they had bought real estate during this time period.\u201d\nCape Coral\u2013Fort Myers tops in supply\nCape Coral\u2013Fort Myers stands out for its unusually high inventory relative to demand conditions.\nWith 7,910 active listings \u2014 the 15th highest total nationally \u2014 the market is firmly in buyer-friendly territory at an MAI of 27.0.\nIts 4.6 months of inventory is the highest among the major markets reviewed, giving buyers substantially more leverage than in tight coastal metros.\nYear-over-year prices have adjusted downward by 6.4%, and homes stay on the market for an average of 119 days, one of the longest timelines.\nWest Coast, Midwest affordability opposites\nLos Angeles remains the least affordable major metro in the country with a median price of $1,429,500 \u2014 roughly 703% higher than Pittsburgh. The metro commands an extraordinary $703.19 price-per-square-foot, more than doubling most markets analyzed.\nDespite slight price softening, Los Angeles posts a strong seller MAI of 42.8 and has the tightest inventory conditions among major metros at just 1.8 months of supply.\nHousingWire Data confirms that 10 of the top 25 most affordable metros are located in the Midwest, more than any other region.\nThe region posts the lowest average median price nationally at $311,937 and the strongest market activity with an average MAI of 39.3.\nMetros such as Danville, Ill.; Decatur, Ill.; Saginaw, Mich.; and Peoria, Ill. all rank among the country\u2019s most affordable, with many median prices falling below $170,000.\nFinding balance in the South\nThe South \u2014 which contains 129 metros in the HousingWire\u2019s data \u2014 continues to deliver the strongest combination of affordability and market balance.\nThe region\u2019s average median price of $362,244 ranks as the second most affordable nationwide, and its average MAI of 32.3 suggests generally buyer-friendly conditions.\nNotable performers include Oklahoma City, Little Rock, Ark.; Austin, and Nashville, Tenn., \u2014 all of which maintain market balance while offering comparatively lower prices than coastal peers.\nRelated\nMore:\nAustin\nData & Analytics\nFlorida\nHousing Inventory", "extraction_method": "beautifulsoup", "word_count": 949, "success": true}
