{"full_text": "The American Dream of buying a home is still alive, but the path to get there looks very different from decades past.\u00a0Recommended VideoA Coldwell Banker report shared with Fortune shows a staggering 84% of Gen Z say they\u2019re delaying major life milestones like getting married, having children, changing careers, and getting a pet, just to afford to buy a home.Harris Poll surveyed more than 3,000 U.S. adults on behalf of residential and commercial real estate firm Coldwell Banker, and found nearly all Gen Z (97%) and millennials (93%) want to buy a home someday, but the path to homeownership is increasingly difficult due to high home prices, mortgage rates, and other housing costs.\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s no single fix\u201d to making housing more affordable, Jason Waugh, president of Coldwell Banker Affiliates, told Fortune. Rather, it would take \u201cdeclining mortgage rates, growing inventory, and moderating price growth.\u201d\u201cBeyond that, state and local programs offering down payment assistance and tax incentives can significantly ease the financial burden for first time buyers,\u201d he added. \u201cMany may qualify for support they\u2019re not yet aware of.\u201dOther recent data confirms just how difficult it\u2019s been for younger generations to break into the housing market: In 2025, the share of first-time home buyers plummeted to a record low of 21%, while the typical age of first-time buyers climbed to an all-time high of 40 years, according to a National Association of Realtors report released last week.\u201cThe historically low share of first-time buyers underscores the real-world consequences of a housing market starved for affordable inventory,\u201d Jessica Lautz, NAR deputy chief economist and vice president of research, said in a statement. \u201cThe share of first-time buyers in the market has contracted by 50% since 2007\u2014right before the Great Recession.\u201dThe Coldwell Banker report also shows 53% of aspiring first-time homeowners don\u2019t expect to buy their first home until they\u2019re at least 40, suggesting milestones like starting families could be pushed back even further.The housing affordability crisisOne of the most frustrating aspects of today\u2019s housing market is hopeful homebuyers can remember the sub-3% mortgage rates of the pandemic era. Now, home rates continue to hover over 6%, and home prices have skyrocketed about 50% in just the past five years, according to the Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index.Meanwhile, Americans need to make about $141,000 to afford a median-priced home, according to a National Association of Home Builders report, but the average salary for a person in the U.S. is about half of that.\u00a0\u201cThe income needed to buy a home in the U.S. \u201cremains significantly higher than before the [COVID-19] pandemic, underscoring the ongoing challenge of affordability even as market conditions gradually rebalance,\u201d Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale previously said in a statement.Gen Z is trying\u00a0Although the path to homeownership \u201cmay be more complex for Gen Z,\u201d Waugh said, they\u2019re also a generation that\u2019s resourceful and determined.\u00a0Many Gen Zers are taking on side hustles for supplemental income streams, he said, and they\u2019re also considering buying less ideal homes like something smaller of a fixer upper. Some are also moving to more affordable areas, cobuying with family or friends, or moving in with parents to save up to buy a home.\u00a0Waugh gave an example of a 20-year-old client who chose to forgo college, began working at 17, and spent three years saving while living with his parents to save enough money to buy a house of his own.\u201cThis openness to multigenerational living and creative financial strategies suggests that\u2014rather than being unattainable\u2014the American Dream is being redefined by Gen Z to align with evolving economic realities,\u201d Waugh said.", "extraction_method": "beautifulsoup", "word_count": 597, "success": true}
