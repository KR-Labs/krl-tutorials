Research shows homeowners are more likely to align with right-wing politics, while renters are more likely to align with the left\nNov. 18, 2025\n2 min read\n16637041\n\nHousing affordability has become an increasingly polarizing issue, with renters now more likely to align with the left and homeowners now more likely to align with the right.\u00a0\n\nHousing affordability has challenged Americans for several decades, but what's new is how polarizing it has become across the political landscape. According to\u00a0Home Economics, a provider of real estate insights and data, renters are increasingly on the left side of the political spectrum, while homeowners are now more likely to align with the right.\n\nThis trend can be observed in the campaigns and ideologies of current politicians. Recently elected New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, for instance, ran his campaign on affordability for renters. Meanwhile, the Trump administration recently proposed a 50-year mortgage as a way to lower monthly housing payments. While both plans focus on affordability, each appeals to their respective bases.\n\nThere is no filter\u2014education, race, or religion\u2014that comes close to showing the 14-point ideological split we see between renters and owners.\n\nRenters are more left-leaning across the income spectrum, across ages, and in all but 7 states. So it makes complete sense for Mamdani to champion renters and challenge NIMBYism, while Trump focuses on easier homeownership financing.\n\nThis is a political hot potato and we\u2019re wary of putting our thumbs on the scale. But our view\u2014formed through countless analyses and grounded in academic literatured\u2014is that unequal access to housing primarily reflects unequal incomes.\n\nProposed solutions that sidestep this reality\u2014freezing the rent, boosting supply, improving construction productivity, or extending mortgage terms\u2014will merely keep affordability at the top of the agenda, and certainly won\u2019t overcome the force of income inequality that\u2019s been gaining strength since Darwin observed a housing crisis in 1836.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSPONSORED\nSmart decisions start with talk.
