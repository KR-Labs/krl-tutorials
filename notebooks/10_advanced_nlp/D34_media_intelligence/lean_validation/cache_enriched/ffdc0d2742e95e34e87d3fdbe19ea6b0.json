But rates are still elevated when compared to what buyers have faced over the past 15 years, and home prices remain high in Southern Nevada, making it difficult for many would-be buyers to afford a place.\nHome Builders Research President Andrew Smith wrote in this week\u2019s report that affordability is still a \u201clegitimate major hurdle for high numbers of potential buyers,\u201d leading to more of a frozen market in many desirable cities.\n\u201cWe would put Southern Nevada into that bucket at this point,\u201d he added.\nOverall, builders closed 6,824 home sales this year through August in Southern Nevada, down 17 percent from the same eight-month stretch last year, Smith reported.\nBuyers have also pulled back in Southern Nevada\u2019s resale market.\nA total of 1,835 previously owned single-family homes traded hands last month, down 14.2 percent from the same month last year, trade association Las Vegas Realtors reported.\nThe median sales price last month, $480,000, was just below the all-time high of $485,000, which, the association noted, has been reached several times this year.\nAcross the country, steadily falling mortgage rates \u201chaven\u2019t brought many homebuyers to the market,\u201d listing site Redfin reported Thursday.\nIt cited several reasons why demand hasn\u2019t improved yet, including stubbornly high home prices, mortgage rates haven\u2019t fallen far enough, and economic uncertainty, including fears of layoffs or a possible recession.\nLas Vegas, for instance, shed thousands of jobs last month amid an ongoing tourism slump, according to state officials, who found that Nevada\u2019s labor market is \u201clargely stationary.\u201d\nContact Eli Segall at esegall@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0342.\nPosted on: Business, HousingTagged: mc-business", "extraction_method": "beautifulsoup", "word_count": 635, "success": true}
