Could it potentially allow certain couples or individuals to be able to afford a home that they couldn\u2019t otherwise? Yes, that\u2019s true.\u201d \nAccording to National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Dr. Lawrence Yun, while a 50-year mortgage may slightly ease monthly payments, it comes at the cost of slow equity growth and significantly higher interest\u2014underscoring that the real affordability challenge lies in the lack of homes, not the length of the loan. \n\u201cIf it\u2019s something that made sense, right, I think the private market would have already developed such a product,\u201d said Jones. \u201cThere was a time when even the 30-year mortgage was considered\u2026.\u2019Ohh, you know, is this really a feasible product\u2026. all that kind of stuff.\u201d And you know, we\u2019ve seen that it has been, but I really questioned whether or not a 50-year mortgage is in the interest of homeowners.\u201d \nThe Missouri Relators Association has not weighed in on the issue yet. \nCopyright \u00a9 2025 \u00b7 Missourinet \n\n\nShare this:\n\n\n  \n    \n \n\nSEARCH THIS SITE\n \n Search for:    \n\nNEVER MISS A POST!\n\n\n Email address:    \n  Leave this field empty if you're human: \n \n \nRecent Articles \n \n Missouri Congressman Alford urges Trump to keep World Cup games in KC; Mayor Lucas, \u2018We\u2019ll be fine\u2019  \n Year-end rush to the doctor for Missouri patients  \n Missouri Senator Schmitt Pushes to Overhaul Federal Program Allowing Foreign Students to Work in U.S.  \n Thanksgiving Dinner Costs Drop in Missouri, Survey Shows  \n UMSL economist on efforts to phase out Missouri\u2019s income tax        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCONTACT \n \n\n505 Hobbs Road\nJefferson City, MO, 65109 \nMissourinet is a division of LEARFIELD \n \nFollow\nFollow\nFollow\nFollow  \n \n \n\nNEVER MISS A POST!\n \nSubscribe here to get our latest news and information delivered to your inbox. \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nSuccess!  \n \n First Name   \n Last Name   \n Email   \n   Subscribe             \n \n \n \n \n\n\u00a9 Learfield News & Ag, LLC.
