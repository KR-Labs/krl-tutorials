(Brian Cassella/Chicago Tribune)\nBy The Editorial Board | Chicago TribunePUBLISHED: October 27, 2025 at 5:00 AM CDT Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...Chicago long has dangled the big-city experience without the New York or San Francisco price tag. That advantage is slipping away.\nA new report from Zillow shows that rents are growing faster in Chicago than any other major metro.\nSure, our population isn\u2019t booming, but that doesn\u2019t mean demand isn\u2019t high. Demonstrably, construction isn\u2019t keeping up. The Chicago metro area is building fewer new residential units than other major metros.\nIn many other cities, construction has caught up with demand, meaning renters are getting a break on rent affordability. But that\u2019s not the case in the Chicago area, where rents shot up 6% over the past year, according to Zillow data. Rents in some suburbs rose over 10%. Meanwhile, rents in Austin fell 3.3% \u2014 the largest drop among major cities \u2014 followed by declines of 2.1% in Denver and 1.1% in San Antonio.\nA typical rental in Chicago now costs an eye-popping $2,213 a month, up roughly $138 from a year ago and up more than $680 from a decade ago. Zillow also found you need to earn about $88,500 to comfortably afford typical rent here.\nWhy? As with anything, a lot goes into this phenomenon, and Chicago remains a popular landing spot for recent college grads and other professionals.\nBut the stark reality at play is that it\u2019s hard to build here, and we\u2019re not doing enough of it. Supply and demand have taken care of the rest in the form of higher rents (which are also being driven up as property owners have to cover their ever-growing property tax bills).\nTo be sure, rent is still much less affordable in large metro areas such as New York, where housing costs take up 41% of household budgets compared with 27% in Chicago.\nWe won\u2019t lose our reputation as a livable metro overnight. But that doesn\u2019t mean we should disregard the trends. Potential new residents won\u2019t.\n\u201cWhile Chicago has traditionally drawn many graduates from nearby universities, especially in the Big Ten, that\u2019s not guaranteed to continue if these trends persist, especially now that remote work gives more people flexibility to live anywhere,\u201d wrote Orphe Divounguy, senior economist at Zillow.\nThe bottom line? Chicago needs to build.\nIn 2024, Chicago-area municipalities issued just 4.6 housing permits per 1,000 existing homes \u2014 less than half the national rate of 10.1 and the lowest among major U.S. metros, according to Construction Coverage, an analytics service for builders and realtors. Divounguy noted that builders have been able to better keep up with demand \u2014 and keep affordability from deteriorating \u2014 in metro areas with fewer building regulations and less-stringent zoning rules.\nJust look out West. Housing costs have been going up in Denver for years, with many priced out of this competitive market. Yet while rent is climbing higher in Chicago, it\u2019s actually going down in Denver. It\u2019s also worth noting that developers built about 20,000 new apartments in the Denver metro area last year, according to the Denver Post.\nTurns out building lots of new apartments brings down rents.\nWe\u2019d like to have that problem in Chicago.\nSubmit a letter, of no more than 400 words, to the editor here or email letters@chicagotribune.com.\nShare this:\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook\nClick to share on Bluesky (Opens in new window)\nBluesky\nClick to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX\nClick to print (Opens in new window)\nPrint\nClick to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)\nEmail\nRevContent Feed\nMost PopularMost Popular\u2018You\u2019re going to wish that doesn\u2019t happen to you\u2019\u2018You\u2019re going to wish that doesn\u2019t happen to you\u2019Unlikely heroes keep arising for 1st-place Chicago Bears: Brad Biggs\u2019 10 thoughts on the Week 12 winUnlikely heroes keep arising for 1st-place Chicago Bears: Brad Biggs' 10 thoughts on the Week 12 winIHSA state football playoffs: Complete semifinal scores from Class 8A to 1AIHSA state football playoffs: Complete semifinal scores from Class 8A to 1ATwo killed, one wounded in shooting at Two Brothers Roundhouse in AuroraTwo killed, one wounded in shooting at Two Brothers Roundhouse in Aurora14-year-old killed in downtown shooting during Friday \u2018teen takeover\u2019 identified, his death ruled a homicide14-year-old killed in downtown shooting during Friday 'teen takeover' identified, his death ruled a homicideWeek 12 recap: Chicago Bears hang on for their 8th win in 9 games, beating Pittsburgh Steelers 31-28Week 12 recap: Chicago Bears hang on for their 8th win in 9 games, beating Pittsburgh Steelers 31-28Heidi Stevens: After Trump\u2019s \u2018Quiet, piggy\u2019 moment, we\u2019re done asking why survivors don\u2019t come forward, right?Heidi Stevens: After Trump's 'Quiet, piggy' moment, we're done asking why survivors don't come forward, right?14-year-old killed, 8 teens injured in chaotic downtown Chicago shootings during \u2018teen takeover\u201914-year-old killed, 8 teens injured in chaotic downtown Chicago shootings during \u2018teen takeover\u2019Editorial: The bond vigilantes are coming for the city of Chicago.
