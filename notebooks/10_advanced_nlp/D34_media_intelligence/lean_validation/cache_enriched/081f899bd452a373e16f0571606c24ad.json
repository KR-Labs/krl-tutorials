The project, part of Boston's Compact Living Pilot Program, offers smaller-than-standard studio apartments \u2014 each approximately 280 square feet.Vivian shared that she independently navigated complex permitting processes for the building's construction.The couple previously renovated a triple-decker and opened Homestead Caf\u00e9 in Fields Corner in 2016. There, they met Julie Baker, a regular customer and co-producer of a storytelling show hosted at the caf\u00e9.Baker, a single mother who previously lived in a large duplex and a substandard apartment, now finds her micro-unit transformative. She described the importance of light and minimal possessions for her happiness.\u201cI love it so much,\u201d she said in a statement shared with NBC10 Boston. \u201cI was worried I'd feel cramped. I don't. The windows help, all the light helps \u2014 light is very important to me.\u201dThe Girards' building includes shared amenities like laundry, bike storage, and a backyard mural painted by Elisa that borders a community garden. Each unit rents for $750 to $870 per month, including heat and hot water. Tenants pay for electricity and internet.Baker explained that the micro-apartments embody a minimalist lifestyle that rejects consumerism. Tenants here value light, space, and simplicity, viewing micro-living as a way to reduce material possessions.The project, which has received considerable community support, has all units currently occupied and a long waiting list.\u201cIt helps to try a new initiative like this,\u201d Vivian said in a statement shared with NBC10 Boston. \u201cNot everything works, but if you don't try, you never find out.\u201dShare this storyBostonDorchesterMichael VyskocilWriterRelated StoriesLocal NewsReport: Boston Harbor Visitor Numbers Drop by Half of 2019 LevelsMichael VyskocilLocal NewsMassachusetts Secures $106 Million in Federal Funding for Transit UpgradesMichael VyskocilLocal News170 Mass.
