Buyers and sellers defied seasonal cooling patterns to turn in the strongest October housing market in three years, according to the\u00a0latest market report1\u00a0from Zillow\u00ae. Improved housing affordability\u00a0\u00a0helped drive a rare fall surge in sellers both listing their homes and accepting offers from buyers; both metrics are up 5% year over year to levels not seen in October since 2022, and both stayed flat from September instead of ticking down, as they typically do this time of year.\n\nDEEPER DIVE:\u00a0Top 10 Arizona ZIP codes people are moving to in 2025\n\nLOCAL NEWS:\u00a0100 best places to work and live in Arizona for 2025\n\n\u201cBuyers and sellers both got some badly needed relief to perk up what is typically a shoulder season for the housing market. The reaction to lower rates shows that buyers are ready to make offers when affordability improves,\u201d said Kara Ng, Zillow senior economist. \u201cWhile fall has been a sneaky good market for buyers and sellers who stuck it out past the busy season, winter is coming, and it may bring rate volatility with it. This warm-up is not guaranteed to last.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe average 30-year mortgage rate eased to 6.25%, reaching the\u00a0lowest monthly average2\u00a0in more than a year. Home values stayed steady from last year, with the typical U.S. home value up 0.1% from last October to $362,117, according to the Zillow Home Value Index. Together those factors reduced mortgage payments by 1.8% compared to last October.3\u00a0\n\nPaired with rising incomes, this has\u00a0improved affordability\u00a0for new home buyers to three-year highs \u2014 though costs are still a significant challenge. The median-earning household would spend 32.9% of its income on a mortgage on the typical home, given a 20% down payment. That\u2019s the smallest share of income needed since August 2022. However, it\u2019s still higher than the 30% threshold at which housing is considered a financial burden, and a 20% down payment is a serious hurdle at more than $72,000.\u00a0\n\nMore sellers test the market ahead of the holidays\n\nSellers reemerged in October after a sluggish summer, taking advantage of stronger demand and enjoying increased affordability themselves if they purchased another home. New listings picked up most compared to last year in Tampa, Raleigh, Orlando, Columbus, Louisville and Indianapolis.\n\nTotal inventory has risen 12.8% since last year and is 17.3% lower than 2018\u20132019 averages for this time of year. This is the smallest supply deficit since the pandemic began in March 2020 and a vast improvement over the 51% shortfall seen in February 2022, when the supply shortfall was largest.\n\nHousing affordability improves as buyers seize lower rates\n\nBuyers also responded quickly to the rate reprieve and improved ousing affordability. Newly pending listings fell just 0.1% from September, but climbed 5% from a year earlier, signaling resilience in a month when demand typically tapers off.\n\nThe sharpest increases in newly pending sales were seen in Tampa, Boston, Orlando, Jacksonville and Miami, where activity rebounded from last year\u2019s unusually slow conditions and \u201csnowbird\u201d demand likely provided a boost.\n\nCompetition cools, bringing buyers markets to new frontiers\n\nZillow\u2019s\u00a0Market Heat Index\u00a0shows competition among buyers is easing along seasonal lines and is far cooler than in past years.\u00a0\n\nThe market is balanced on the national scale, but 19 major markets now favor buyers, three more markets than in September and up from nine last October. These are concentrated in the South, but cold weather and accumulating inventory are bringing them farther north and west; new additions in October were Cincinnati, Milwaukee and Birmingham.\n\nSellers retain the strongest edge in Hartford, San Francisco, New York, San Jose and Providence, while Miami, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh and New Orleans rank among the country\u2019s strongest buyers markets.\n\nMetro Area*\tZillow Home\nValue Index (ZHVI)\tZHVI Year over Year (YoY)\tNewly Pending Listings Change YoY\tMarket Favors (Zillow Market Heat
