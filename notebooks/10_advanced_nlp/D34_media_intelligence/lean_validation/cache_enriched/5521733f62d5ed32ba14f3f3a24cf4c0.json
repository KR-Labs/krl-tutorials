{"full_text": "Mortgage rates have remained stubbornly high: hovering at more than 6%, well above the sub-3% rates during the pandemic. That makes homeownership increasingly unaffordable for many Americans, as home prices have risen more than 50% since 2020.During the pandemic, home buyers got accustomed to sub-3% mortgage rates, which made purchasing a house feel more achievable. But in the past couple of years, buyers have had no such luck.Recommended VideoIn late 2023, mortgage rates peaked at 8%. They\u2019ve let up some, today\u2019s 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.19%, according to Mortgage News Daily, but economists and real-estate groups have warned they don\u2019t see that figure budging much in the near future. And to make matters worse, some have said the mortgage rate it would take to make homes feel affordable again isn\u2019t achievable.\u00a0This summer, Zillow economic analyst Anushna Prakash reported mortgage rates would need to drop to 4.43% for a typical home to be affordable to an average buyer. But \u201cthat kind of a rate decline is currently unrealistic,\u201d Prakash wrote. Meanwhile, not even a 0% interest rate would make a typical home affordable in New York, Los Angeles, Miami, San Francisco, San Diego, or San Jose, she added.\u00a0Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices also said in an early July report mortgage rates are one of the main deterrents for both home buyers and sellers.\u201cMany homeowners are reluctant [to] put their homes on the market and give up the low mortgage rates they already have,\u201d according to Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices. \u201cTo them, high price gains won\u2019t mitigate their ability to pay more for another home at significantly higher interest rates.\u201dThis issue is also referred to as golden handcuffs\u2014or the locked-in mortgage rate effect. The idea is that current homeowners have no incentive to put their homes on the market, even if they want to move, because they\u2019d forgo a much lower mortgage rate they had locked in years ago.\u00a0This causes a litany of other problems in the housing market, namely inventory.The homebuilder unsold completed inventory recently hit a 16-year high, according to ResiClub, and data from real estate intelligence platform Parcl Labs shows the number of active listings on the market this summer rose to 3.06 million, a 4.9% increase from the same time last year. Meanwhile, more sellers delisting their properties after sitting on the market for longer than expected.\u201cHomes are sitting on the market nearly three weeks longer than last year,\u201d Realtor.com Senior Economist Jake Krimmel recently told Fortune. \u201cThat\u2019s a sign of sellers still anchored to pandemic-era prices even though the market is telling them otherwise.\u201d\u00a0That doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s an influx of housing in the U.S.; in fact, we\u2019re still short millions of units. It just means there aren\u2019t enough people who can actually afford to buy a home.The factors influencing housing affordabilityAlthough inventory levels are increasing, home prices and mortgage rates continue to be a roadblock for potential home buyers. Mortgage rates have remained \u201cstubbornly high,\u201d Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices said, deterring new buyers from the market.According to an October Realtor.com report, the typical home spent 62 days on the market in July, roughly as long as it took to sell before the pandemic.Mortgage rates are certainly a factor among buyers when deciding to make an offer, and home prices are also up more than 50% since the onset of the pandemic, according to the U.S. Case-Shiller Home Price Index.All the while, wages haven\u2019t grown at the same pace as home appreciation, making buying a house feel even more unaffordable. And if nothing changes like mortgage rates, inventory, or wage growth, it\u2019s likely the housing affordability crisis in the U.S. will persist, Alexandra Gupta, a real-estate broker with The Corcoran Group, told Fortune.\u201cSome first-time buyers are turning to long-term renting or even co-living models because the idea of owning a home has become so out of reach. Others are relying more on family support to get into the market,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a reshaping of the housing ladder.\u201dThe small glimmer of hope, though, is home price growth appears to be slowing, according to the Case-Shiller indices.\u201cWith affordability still stretched and inventory constrained, national home prices are holding steady, but barely,\u201d Nicholas Godec, head of fixed-income tradables and commodities at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said in a statement.A version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on July 31, 2025.Fortune Brainstorm AI returns to San Francisco Dec. 8\u20139 to convene the smartest people we know\u2014technologists, entrepreneurs, Fortune Global 500 executives, investors, policymakers, and the brilliant minds in between\u2014to explore and interrogate the most pressing questions about AI at another pivotal moment.
