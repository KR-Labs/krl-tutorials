{"full_text": "The American dream of homeownership, long a symbol of stability, achievement, and upward mobility, is facing unprecedented challenges as the median age of the average first-time homebuyer in the United States has soared to 40 years old, according to newly released data from the National Association of Realtors (NAR). Recommended VideoA year ago, the median age was 38 years old, and that\u2019s up from 36 in 2022, 33 in 2020 and 28 in 1991. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a shocking number,\u201d said Jessica Lautz, deputy chief economist and vice president of research at NAR. \u201cAnd it\u2019s really been in recent years that we\u2019ve seen this steep climb.\u201dThis age milestone marks an era where the affordability crisis is fundamentally reshaping the housing landscape and delaying access to the benefits of homeownership for millions of Americans.As ResiClub editor Lance Lambert contextualized it in a statement to Fortune, this means the first-time homebuyer in 2025 is \u201cjust as close in time to the age when they can begin early Social Security withdrawals (age 62) as they are to their high school graduation (age 18).\u201dThe NAR\u2019s 2025 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers, which surveyed recent home transactions between July 2024 and June 2025, also revealed that first-time buyers now comprise just 21% of all home purchases\u2014a historic low.\u201cThe historically low share of first-time buyers underscores the real-world consequences of a housing market starved for affordable inventory,\u201d Lautz said. This steep decline\u2014a contraction of 50% since 2007\u2014has significant ripple effects: not only does it delay or deny wealth accumulation for families, but it also means lost opportunities. NAR estimates a 10-year delay in homeownership could mean losing about $150,000 in equity on a typical starter home over a lifetime.New Barriers for Younger BuyersToday\u2019s first-time homebuyers face arduous financial hurdles. The typical down payment is now 10%, matching the highest level recorded since 1989. Most rely on their personal savings (59%), but a significant contingent is tapping financial assets like 401(k)s and investment accounts (26%), while over one in five are depending on gifts or loans from family or friends (22%). This underscores how entry into homeownership has become less accessible for those without substantial family support or generational wealth.In stark contrast, repeat buyers, whose median age is 62, are better positioned\u2014often wielding equity from previous sales for larger down payments, and 30% can buy homes outright with cash. The result is a bifurcated market, where older, established homeowners find mobility and security, while younger would-be buyers wait longer and risk missing out on key wealth-building years. As Fortune has reported, this looks like boomers beating millennials in the competition for housing. If you\u2019re 40 years old, you have to compete with someone your parents\u2019 or aunts and uncles\u2019 age for that elusive starter home, in other words.Societal Shifts and Multigenerational TrendsThe NAR profile also shows that only 24% of buyers have children under the age of 18 at home, yet another all-time low. Meanwhile, the share of Americans buying multigenerational homes, where owners care for aging parents and children moving back after college, has dropped to 14% from 17% in 2024.The crisis has brought housing policy to the forefront of the national conversation. Shannon McGahn, NAR executive vice president and chief advocacy officer, stressed the urgent need to address the underlying causes of the affordability crunch, namely the inadequate supply of homes. She called for policies to unlock existing inventory, revitalize underused properties, streamline zoning and permitting barriers, and modernize construction methods to boost affordable, rapid development. Without such action, the dream of homeownership\u2014and the social mobility it promises\u2014may continue to slip further from reach for ordinary Americans.\u201cFor generations, access to homeownership has been the primary way Americans build wealth and the cornerstone of the American Dream,\u201d McGahn said.", "extraction_method": "beautifulsoup", "word_count": 624, "success": true}
