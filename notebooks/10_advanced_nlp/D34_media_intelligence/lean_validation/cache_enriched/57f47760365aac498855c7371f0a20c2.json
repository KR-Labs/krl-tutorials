(Loveland Planning Commission documents)\nBy Jocelyn Rowley | jrowley@prairiemountainmedia.com | Loveland Reporter-HeraldPUBLISHED: October 24, 2025 at 10:20 AM MDT Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...There might not be easy answers to Loveland\u2019s affordable housing crisis, but that doesn\u2019t mean there are no answers.\nOn Thursday, about 40 people gathered at the Mirasol Event Center to learn more about the challenges in the local housing market with three of the people working hardest to overcome them:\u00a0 Jeff Feneis, executive director of the Loveland Housing Authority; Jammie Sabin, co-owner of Aspen Homes of Colorado; and Alison Hade,\u00a0the city\u2019s community partnership administrator.\nThe two-hour event was co-hosted by the League of Women Voters and the city\u2019s Affordable Housing Task Force. It began with the basics \u2014 what constitutes affordable housing and why there is a lack of it in Northern Colorado.\nAccording to Julie Stackhouse,\u00a0a LWV member and\u00a0 a retired executive vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, \u201caffordable housing\u201d often means different things to different people, but there are some official parameters for it set by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nPer HUD, a household\u2019s housing is considered affordable when it costs less than 30% of gross income. For a household earning $5,000 a month, that translates to no more than $1,500\u00a0in rent or mortgage payments, plus utilities.\nBut housing priced at that point is very hard to find in the Fort Collins-Loveland area these days due to population growth over the last several years that has outstripped the supply of available units. As a result, Stackhouse told the audience, the median sales price of a single-family home has quadrupled since 1995 to $580,000.\nContinuing, Stackhouse said that escalating input costs for construction are also driving high housing prices, mostly thanks to the high cost of water.\n\u201cWater is a big deal here, and not just because water is scarce and expensive,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s because, depending on which water company you\u2019re working with, you\u2019re going to have a different set of criteria to abide by.\u201d\nAfter the table was set with the data, the three panelists took turns answering questions about what the city is doing right to alleviate the housing crisis and what remains to be done.\nTo the first question, both Feneis and Sabin praised the city\u2019s efforts to be an active partner in finding solutions through the task force, which was formed in 2021 and tasked with expanding housing options for working families.\nBoth also said that close collaboration between developers, builders and the city had been the key to several affordable projects in Loveland, such as Legacy Crossing, a 60-acre neighborhood near Taft Avenue and 57th Street being developed by the Housing Authority in partnership with three homebuilders. When completed, it will include roughly 330 homes serving families from 40 percent to 120 percent\u00a0of the area median income.\n\u201cI do feel very fortunate that we\u2019re in Loveland in the support that the affordable housing community has received is tremendous,\u201d said Feneis. \u201cAnd I\u2019m optimistic a lot of the work that\u2019s been happening the last three, four years through the task force, which couldn\u2019t happen without the city\u2019s involvement, is starting to come to fruition.\u201d\nHade outlined several recent policy changes designed to reduce costs, including fee waivers for affordable units and a \u201cscalable\u201d fee model that adjusts water and utility fees based on home size. Beginning in January, Loveland will become the first city in Colorado to adopt that model. Smaller homes will also pay proportionally lower capital-expansion fees, which fund parks, police and other infrastructure.\n\u201cThese policies took a lot of time and hard work to develop,\u201d Hade said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of really good work and a great collaboration with city departments.\u201d\nStill, the city faces obstacles, notably an out-of-date comprehensive plan that complicates approval of mixed-density or nontraditional housing developments, according to Hade.\n\u201cThe comprehensive plan should be updated every 10 years,\u201d Hade said. \u201cIt\u2019s overdue, and we don\u2019t have the money to do it. That\u2019s an obstacle to producing the kind of housing people want.\u201d\nAnother, panelists agreed, is community resistance.\n\u201cEveryone wants affordable housing in Loveland,\u201d Sabin said, \u201cbut a lot of people don\u2019t want it next to them. We have a large NIMBY contingent that is vocal and organized.\u201d\nHe urged residents who support new housing to counterbalance that opposition by speaking up at public hearings.\n\u201cYour voice matters,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be an expert \u2014 just show up and say this is the kind of project we need.\u201d\nAudience questions touched on the role of metro districts, manufactured housing and accessory dwelling units (ADUs), as well as Proposition 123, a state program requiring participating cities to increase affordable housing stock by 3 percent per year to qualify for construction funding.\nWhile none of the speakers claimed there was a silver bullet, all three emphasized that Loveland is moving in the right direction, even if the journey will be a long one.\n\u201cFrom my perspective, the Affordable Housing Task Force and the city staff have been working for the last several years, and the impact of that is just about to get to the market next year and the year after and then you\u2019ll start seeing some real changes,\u201d Sabin said.\nShare this:\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook\nClick to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX\nRevContent Feed\nEvents\nMost PopularMost PopularAsking Eric: Family punished for missing wedding 50 years laterAsking Eric: Family punished for missing wedding 50 years laterDirt likely to fly starting in 2026 on NISP water projectDirt likely to fly starting in 2026 on NISP water projectNorthern Colorado home day care owner charged with child abuseNorthern Colorado home day care owner charged with child abuseThings to do in the Loveland area Monday, Nov. 24: Christmas open house; All is Bright light showThings to do in the Loveland area Monday, Nov. 24: Christmas open house; All is Bright light showCSU quarterback Darius Curry suspended for unsportsmanlike conduct against Boise StateCSU quarterback Darius Curry suspended for unsportsmanlike conduct against Boise StateA new era: Loveland Mayor Pat McFall aims to restore order and rebuild trustA new era: Loveland Mayor Pat McFall aims to restore order and rebuild trust\u2018Berthoud Deserves a Vote\u2019 campaign puts downtown project in jeopardy\u2018Berthoud Deserves a Vote\u2019 campaign puts downtown project in jeopardyThings to do in the Loveland area Sunday, Nov. 23: Holiday lights, Garrison KeillorThings to do in the Loveland area Sunday, Nov. 23: Holiday lights, Garrison KeillorDriver killed in westbound I-70 crash near PalisadeDriver killed in westbound I-70 crash near PalisadeUpcoming in the Loveland area: train show, concerts and moreUpcoming in the Loveland area: train show, concerts and more", "extraction_method": "beautifulsoup", "word_count": 1191, "success": true}
