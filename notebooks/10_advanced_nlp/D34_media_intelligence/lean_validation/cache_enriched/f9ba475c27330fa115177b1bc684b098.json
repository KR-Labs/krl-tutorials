The list includes GreyStar, Camden Property Trust, Cortland Management and Willow Bridge Property Co. Agreements they have with Richardson-based Realpage likely harmed competition and pushed up rental prices, the government said in court documents.AdvertisementArticle continues below this adA Washington Post analysis identified Austin as the city most impacted, with 46% of multifamily units being managed by landlords using RealPage\u2019s artificial intelligence-driven system.FROM JANUARY: Texas-based landlords accused of price-fixing rents, DOJ lawsuit claimsThe company says both that study and another, which ranked Austin fifth among AI rent-pricing markets, were flawed.

The U.S. has accused it of illegal price fixing.Lola Gomez/Tribune News Service\u201cUnfortunately, much of the debate has been fueled by serious misrepresentations about how revenue management software actually works and the value it provides for both housing providers and renters,\u201d Jennifer Bowcock, RealPage senior vice president of communications, said in an emailed response to questions. \u201cRelated legislative activity has been animated by biased political efforts to claim quick wins.\u201d\u00a0The suit and others targeting RealPage stem from use of the company\u2019s AI-based revenue management software, which allows landlords to share information on rents, vacancies, and other nonpublic data with each other. The software can then suggest higher rents, helping landlords present a united front rather than competing for customers through concessions or lower rents, according to the Justice Department.The company\u2019s software\u00a0\u2014 which court documents show some executives called \u201cclassic price fixing\u201d\u00a0\u2014 was popular, gobbling up 80% of the market. \u00a0AdvertisementArticle continues below this adThe company set up a website to address the criticism it\u2019s faced since the suit and others were filed. It says increases in rental prices are caused by an undersupply of housing units and inflation, not its software and analytics.Broader impactBut now RealPage, once the toast of corporate landlords, is facing public criticism, bans in some states and former clients that say they will help the Justice Department prosecute the software giant.

The use of similiar practices by hotels and health insurance providers has also been alleged. That means the outcome of the RealPage case could have wider impacts.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s very important,\u201d said Bill Baer, former director of competition at the Federal Trade Commission and U.S. assistant attorney general over antitrust. \u201cHopefully it will return to consumers the benefit of real competition for rental apartments.\u201dLast year the Biden Administration estimated the average additional cost to consumers of AI-price coordination was $70 per month of rent nationally, or $3.8 billion. In Dallas, it was estimated the system was costing renters $136 extra each month. It provided no specific estimate for Austin.AdvertisementArticle continues below this adBut Austin has long struggled with housing affordability. Price surges in the past decade made it one of the most costly cities to rent in. And only recently has it felt relief as rental prices fell the past two years. But it\u2019s still nearly 17% higher than pre-pandemic levels, according to Zillow.\u00a0\u201cLack of supply is the root cause of the housing affordability crisis,\u201d RealPage stated on its website. In a statement they note Austin\u2019s prices only fell when housing supply grew.What\u2019s alleged?The Justice Department and 10 state\u2019s attorneys general said in a 115-page civil court filing that RealPage software allowed the nation\u2019s biggest landlords to share nonpublic data about vacancy rates, leasing prices and costs then made recommendations on how to maximize profits to the detriment of consumers. Rather than run promotions and drop prices to get customers, landlords using the software might keep apartments off the market, and prices up, or suggest higher rents in a coordinated effort.AdvertisementArticle continues below this adRealPage has denied it ever recommended keeping apartments off the market and maintains its product doesn\u2019t break the law.\u00a0RealPage collects information from its clients that lawsuits allege have kept rents high in cities including Austin.Ken Ellis/Houston Chronicle illustrationThe algorithmic-suggestions essentially took away all competition, the DOJ said, replacing the smoke-filled back rooms of old with digital databases and dashboards\u00a0\u2014 and giving massive property owners plausible deniability, Baer said.\u00a0\u201cIt gives the companies who submit data and get back recommended pricing \u2026 [the ability to say] \u2018Well, I didn\u2019t do it, The algorithm just did it.

Cities in multiple states have banned the use of AI-rent setting and 22 states have considered or are considering legislation banning software like RealPage.

It made no admission of wrongdoing and was able to continue using nonpublic data to generate rent recommendations as long as they were based on data that was three-months old and anonymized.The company is fighting back, too. It sued the city of Berkeley, Calif., over its ordinance banning the software, saying it was \u201cprompted by an intentional campaign of misinformation and often-repeated false claims about the company\u2019s revenue management software.\u201dAustin rentsAustin rents have been declining for more than a year after an apartment building boom increased supply and drove down prices. But rents are still high enought that, according to a Harvard University study last year, more than half of the region\u2019s renters are cost burdened\u00a0\u2014 meaning they\u2019re spending more than 30% of their income on housing.\u00a0AdvertisementArticle continues below this adThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development estimated that the fair market rental rate for an efficiency in the Austin-Round Rock metropolitan statistical area in 2015 was $681. In 2025 it was $1,549\u00a0\u2014 an increase of 127%.\u00a0According to the Justice\u2019s Department\u2019s complaint, RealPage is designed to keep rents artificially high regardless of market forces. Court documents imply markets like Austin that have seen some relief on rents, may have been more affordable without RealPage\u2019s involvement.\u00a0Quoted in court documents, RealPage information appears to support that assertion: \u201cOur tool \u2026 ensures that [landlords] are driving every possible opportunity to increase price even in the most downward trending or unexpected conditions.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0K Agbebiyi, senior housing campaign coordinator at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, said its data shows that rents for the poorest residents have been affected more than those for other economic groups.\u00a0AdvertisementArticle continues below this ad\u201cIt\u2019s going to be the poorer tenants that are largely hit by these rent prices,\u201d they said.Online tools allow would-be renters to search for aparements and rental rates.AndreyPopov/Getty ImagesBut Agdebiyi rejected the idea that simply banning RealPage would reverse rising housing prices. While the organization has said RealPage is harmful to the rental landscape, it agrees the company has been scapegoated. That\u2019s because the issues of affordability go far beyond RealPage\u2019s control, including the rise of private equity in rental markets, the project says. But RealPage is an easier target for people to understand, they said.\u00a0\u201cI think instead it\u2019s easier for states to be like, \u2018Oh, well, rent is really high because of this, like, boogie man,\u2019 \" Agdebiyi said of cities and states that are going after the company.AdvertisementArticle continues below this adAI-fueled gougingRent rates are not the only costs for which AI-price gouging has been alleged.
