{"full_text": "What brokers need to know about how young buyers differ from generations past\nBy\nMatt Sexton\n24 Nov 2025\nShare\nWhile politicians continue wringing their hands and throwing things at the wall in an effort to address housing affordability challenges, younger borrowers are already thinking two steps ahead.\nSince it doesn\u2019t seem as if the government is going to help with the issue anytime soon, those looking for their first house are having to assess not just the impact of a mortgage payment, but also other expenses on their budgets.\nAccording to the latest data collected by JD Power, young borrowers are concerned about how these large house payments will affect their way of life.\nBruce Gehrke (pictured top), senior director of wealth and lending intelligence at JD Power, said borrowers don\u2019t believe the process is as easy as it used to be, largely due to the current market headwinds.\n\u201cYou have the affordability challenges, you have the restricted supply out there, multiple offers, bidding wars, and things of that nature,\u201d Gehrke told Mortgage Professional America. \u201cConsumers have this perception going in that this wasn't as simple as it was once before, where you just kind of walk in, find the house you want, put down an offer, go back and forth, and you're ready to close.\u201d\nMore complications\nBuyers in the survey don\u2019t perceive the mortgage process as easy as it once was, and they\u2019re approaching a broker or originator with many more questions about how their finances will be affected.\n\u201cNow you have this perception that there are more complications involved,\u201d Gehrke said. \u201cI want to know more about the affordability issues. What can I afford? Not just what will I qualify for, but what fits into my lifestyle? And we see differences across demographics, especially among younger borrowers. They're not as willing, in some cases, to spend as much on housing relative to their income.\u201d\nGehrke believes the younger generation of buyers has more places where their expendable income is going, compared to previous generations who might tighten discretionary spending in order to afford a home payment.\n\u201cSo they're spending more money on other things, whether it's streaming services, whether it's Starbucks,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere traditionally you go back a couple of generations, and people were eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for two years to afford a home, because that was a priority for them.\u201d\nBuyers want to know not only how a new mortgage payment fits into the budget, but also how the total costs of owning a home will affect them. Gehrke is seeing buyers showing regret because the actual financial impact of homeownership on the family budget may be more than they bargained for.\n\u201cBorrowers will say, \u2018I want to have an understanding of this before I get down the line,\u2019\u201d Gehrke said. \u201cBecause one of the major points of regret that we see in first-time buyers is, \u2018I didn't have a clear picture of all the costs involved in owning a home, and this is a lot more than I signed up for.\u2019\n\u201cI think what you're seeing now is folks trying to nail that down before they go out there, so that they're looking in the price range and cost structure that they're comfortable with. It's not just \u2018Get me prequalified,\u2019 but \u2018I could get that house, but I'm not comfortable living that way. I'd rather be in this price range, because it fits my lifestyle.\u2019\u201d\nAdvice for brokers\nOne encouraging aspect of this information is that it gives brokers a chance to leverage one of their biggest advantages: building one-on-one relationships with homebuyers. This allows the broker to craft a plan for all buyers, especially younger ones, that best fits their plans.\n\u201cFrom a broker perspective, I think they need to continue to focus on where their competitive advantage has always been,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that's more local, that's more personal, face-to-face with the borrower. I think that's still an advantage that they have.\u201d\nMichael Brennan, President of Nationwide Mortgage Bankers, urges originators to help homeowners leverage equity and manage consumer debt through proactive reviews and strike rate alerts.https://t.co/Htsu4BGceB\n\u2014 Mortgage Professional America Magazine (@MPAMagazineUS) November 23, 2025\nGehrke also sees value in brokers partnering with bigger companies, like Rocket Pro and UWM, which can provide not only the technological backing that a smaller brokerage wouldn\u2019t be able to afford on its own. They can also provide a funnel for leads, helping even the smallest brokers stay busy.\n\u201cI think that the key part for them is to find partners to work with, like lending partners to work with that can give them other advantages,\u201d Gehrke said. \u201cThat's key to working with somebody like Rocket, the same thing with UWM, all those things that they're working to provide to that broker community.\n\u201cIf brokers don't have the kind of budget to create these technological improvements and benefits, they need a partner to do that. I think brokers can equally compete if they have the right partnerships and if they're focused on their competitive advantage, which is that personal relationship.\u201d\nStay updated with the freshest mortgage news.
