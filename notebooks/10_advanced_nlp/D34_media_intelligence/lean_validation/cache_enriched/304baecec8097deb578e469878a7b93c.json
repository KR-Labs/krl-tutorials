This block just 2 miles from the beach is scheduled to be redeveloped in January.Facing a budget crisis and a state mandate to create more housing, members of the City Council, she says, are \u201cjust doing whatever they can\u201d to get more units built.\nWhy We Wrote This\nOne answer to an affordability gap in housing, experts say, is building more units to try to ease the pressure on prices. That can mean changing laws that regulate where and what kinds of housing can be built.\nThe eight-story building will stand out among its mostly one-to-three-story neighbors. It\u2019s one of a half dozen developments that will add over 1,000 units to this coastal city of 91,000 people next to Los Angeles.Average monthly rent is about $3,500 here, among the highest in the United States. Ms. Crane is concerned that the addition of these market-rate units in the highly desirable beach community won\u2019t do anything to bring prices down. \u201cWe are losing our middle class,\u201d she says.But these are the type of projects that pro-housing advocates hope to see more of, and California is making them easier to build. Over the past few months, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a slate of laws aimed at eliminating a deficit of 2.5 million housing units. In support of more and denser housing, lawmakers relaxed the state\u2019s landmark environmental rules, cleared the way for multiunit housing near transit hubs, streamlined building permits, created new funding programs for developers, and increased tax credits for renters.\nRecommended\nMarjorie Taylor Greene\u2019s split with Trump is the talk of her Georgia district\nThe laws are, in part, designed to promote units that are affordable \u2013 generally defined as costing no more than 30% of a family\u2019s income. They move California in the right direction, says Sherri Lawson Clark, a cultural anthropologist at Wake Forest University who studies housing and poverty. If California \u2013 where midtier homes cost more than twice the nationwide average \u2013 can narrow the affordability gap with an influx of new housing, then it could \u201cperhaps be a blueprint for other states and localities,\u201d she says.\nAli Martin/The Christian Science Monitor\nTricia Crane stands a few blocks from her home in front of a half-shuttered commercial building that is scheduled to be replaced with a 170-unit apartment building, Oct. 9, 2025, in Santa Monica, California.\nThe Golden State\u2019s effort faces significant obstacles. Factors like the high cost of construction, concentration of relatively high earners, and high interest rates affect how much it costs to build, buy, and rent units \u2013 which directly impacts their accessibility. In fact, California has enacted a series of reforms over the last decade, only for the crisis to persist.A recent study\u00a0by the McKinsey Institute for Economic Mobility estimates the U.S. is short 8.2 million housing units \u2013 32% more than 10 years ago, despite\u00a0decades in which\u00a0laws have often moved\u00a0toward\u00a0more streamlined permitting and denser housing. The limited supply, says the report, has kept rents and home prices high.California\u2019s need for more housing units, plus a growing disparity between income and housing costs, calls for a \u201cboth/and\u201d solution, says William Fulton, professor of practice at the University of California, San Diego\u2019s department of urban studies and planning. \u201cYou have to build way more housing\u201d in general, he says. \u201cBut you also need to build as much affordable housing as you can.\u201dNew laws could change California landscapeA long-standing state law requires cities to have plans for meeting projected housing needs, and to update those plans every few years. About two-thirds of Santa Monica\u2019s existing housing stock is in buildings with five or more units, according to a 2023 analysis by the Santa Monica Daily Press. The city\u2019s building target is nearly 9,000 new units by 2030. Just over a third of that \u2013 3,400 \u2013 has been completed. Nearly all of it is in multifamily or mixed-use buildings.The new law that allows for more housing near transit hubs clears the way for high-rises of up to nine stories, and overrides any local ordinances.\nRecommended\nMost Americans have avoided shutdown woes. That might change.\nThe wide-ranging reforms reflect the complexities of housing affordability.\u201cThere isn\u2019t a silver bullet here,\u201d says Mr. Fulton. Homes get built at the market\u2019s highest end, where profits are higher, and at the very low end, because that construction is subsidized. But \u201cvery little new housing is being built\u201d for people making $100,000 a year, he says. \u201cThat\u2019s a very complex spot to be in. ... Rents are going up, and they\u2019re the ones who are really getting squeezed.\u201dOnly 15% of Californians can afford to buy a median-priced single-family home in their state, according to the California Association of Realtors. In 2012, it was 56%.Adding market-rate units, even at the high end, helps ease the shortage and expand affordable options, says Mr. Fulton. As people move into more expensive homes, their less expensive units free up for others to move into.\nJeff Chiu/AP/File\nA Bay Area Rapid Transit train approaches a rail station in Daly City, California, near San Francisco, May 9, 2025.\nThis push to expand the kinds of housing available in California communities could reframe the California dream, as condominium and apartment buildings gain legislative support to outpace single-family homes like the ranch, Craftsman, and Spanish bungalows found throughout the LA area.And one significant obstacle to building condos and apartments no longer exists. Faced with the loss of thousands of homes in the LA wildfires, plus the increasing crisis of affordability, lawmakers agreed on limited reforms that ease restrictions on denser building where infrastructure already exists, generally in urban areas.The new law rolls back the landmark California Environmental Quality Act, waiving its regulations for \u201cinfill\u201d projects and clearing the path for a wide range of development, including single-family homes as well as multiunit and mixed-use projects.Housing effort has community impactThe new laws will affect residents in different ways. In some areas, developments have the potential to usher in big changes to traffic patterns and demographics.Ms. Crane moved to Santa Monica with her husband in 1982. They bought a 1920s Spanish bungalow on a leafy street not far from the planned 170-unit building.If that building goes up, she says, not only will traffic increase on the smaller side streets, but it will make parking more difficult as well. She also laments the loss of businesses along the commercial stretch, which has a mix of restaurants, boutiques, grocery stores, and shuttered storefronts.\u201cWe\u2019re losing community,\u201d she says.But the YIMBY movement has had strong backing in the State Legislature. Standing for \u201cYes in My Backyard,\u201d YIMBY counters the idea of supporting solutions as long as they\u2019re implemented somewhere other than near where one lives.\nRecommended\nEPA\u2019s new clean-water rules: What a farmer, builder, and scientist say\nThat \u201cyes\u201d movement, which advocates for more and denser housing, is championed by state Sen. Scott Wiener, who was elected on a pro-housing platform. Governor Newsom campaigned on a promise to lead the state in building millions of new units by 2025. Both say increasing the housing supply will ease the state\u2019s affordability crisis.California YIMBY declared the state\u2019s reform package a \u201clandmark victory\u201d earlier this month in a newsletter. \u201c2025 was by far the biggest year for pro-housing reforms in our history,\u201d the group wrote.But driving around Santa Monica on a tour of the new housing complexes, Ms. Crane calls them \u201ca gift to the developers.\u201d (The Monitor reached out to builders and had no response.)\nAli Martin/The Christian Science Monitor\nMore than 1,000 new apartments are scheduled to be built in Santa Monica, California, a city with about 91,000 residents. One of those developments will replace this stretch of restaurants and services along Wilshire Boulevard.\n\u201cThis is not going to generate affordable units,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is driving the middle class out.\u201dThe National Association of Home Builders published a recent study that determined about 75% of U.S. families could not afford to purchase a median-priced home. For most of the last 20 years, median home prices in the U.S. have exceeded the affordability benchmark of 30% of a family\u2019s income. This year, the median cost of housing in the U.S. shot up to nearly half (47%) of a family\u2019s median income.Miracle McKinney aspires to purchase a home, but for now, \u201cit\u2019s just really survival,\u201d she says.Ms. McKinney estimates she spends close to 70% of her monthly income on housing, even though she lives in a subsidized apartment.
