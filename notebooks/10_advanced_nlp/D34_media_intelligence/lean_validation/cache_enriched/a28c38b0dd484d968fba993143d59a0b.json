(Alyssa Garcia/Emerald)\nThe Eugene City Council held a meeting on Monday, facilitating discussion surrounding Automated License Plate Readers, Amazon distribution facility rumors and housing affordability programs.\nAll councilors were present during the meeting, with Councilor Leech calling in from Zoom.\nDuring the Committee Reports and Items of Interest, Mayor Knudson spoke about community concerns surrounding the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the city.\n\u201cLast week, I joined elected leaders serving at the federal, state and local levels \u2014 indeed many of our city council members \u2014 in opposing the violent detention of our neighbors and the denial of due process to members of our community by (ICE),\u201d Knudson said. \u201cThis situation is not news to us, but it is nonetheless alarming and unacceptable to learn of reported actions carried out by ICE and Lane County.\u201d\nCity Manager Sarah Medary was also present, and spoke briefly before public comment regarding the status of growth research from the Envision Eugene Technical Advisory Committee. Medary said she believes EETAC will have a final report on the city\u2019s economic growth and recommendations by January.\nForty-nine speakers signed up for public comment, many of which used their time to urge the council to permanently take down the ALPRs. Some speakers asked Medary to move quickly in setting up another work session before her retirement in December.\n\u201cA pause is not a stop, and the cameras remain up on the poles. That\u2019s unfortunate, because they are pretty offensive to see, and pretty embarrassing to our visitors as well,\u201d Sam Edwards, one public commentator, said. \u201cI\u2019m here tonight to urge the city manager to move with haste before retiring and get that contract where it belongs \u2014 the paper shredder.\u201d\nAnother group of commentators wore homemade pins which said \u201cSay No To Amazon\u201d and spoke extensively on the new package-and-delivery center being built by the Eugene airport, which has been rumored to be an Amazon distribution center..\n\u201cEmployment that Amazon offers is labor intensive, so intensive that to meet their goals, Amazon will be replacing local workers, in just a few years in 2030, with robots that work faster and don\u2019t need bathroom breaks, or healthcare,\u201d Charmaine Landing, a member of Say No To Amazon, said. \u201cWithout dependable long term jobs, workers can\u2019t plan for a future, which might include owning a home, supporting elders or sending kids to college. I honestly believe Amazon will not be a good partner for Eugene.\u201d\nDanny Patch, another public commentator, was worried about the effect of increased vehicles from the warehouse on traffic.\nMultiple other public commentators urged the council to collaborate with local housing developers to tap into funds for affordable housing granted by the state legislature through the Moderate Income Revolving Loan.\nMIRL is a program that was established during the 2024 legislative session from Senate Bill 1537. The program enables the Oregon Housing and Community Services to offer no-interest loans to cities and jurisdictions that meet specific requirements to build low to moderate income housing.\n\u201c(OCHS has) $50 million for (MIRL), but in that case, the council needs to adopt a resolution to enable the program here locally,\u201d Emily Reiman, CEO of Dev Northwest, a non-profit community development organization, said. \u201cThe city needs to adopt an application process for developers to apply for those funds.\u201d\nWhen public comment concluded, Councilors Clark and Groves expressed their interest in learning more about MIRL, asking for a later discussion with Medary.\nThe next city council meeting is scheduled for Nov. 24.\n1\nView Story Comments\n2\nLike This Story\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X\nEmail this Story\nPrint this Story\nView Comments (1)\nMore to Discover\nMore in City News\nHealth Enrichment for Low-Income Pets provides pet services to the Eugene community\nApproximately 4,000 attend Eugene \u201cNo Kings 2\u201d protest\nFlock cameras to be paused within the next 24 hours\nComposting in Eugene\nTariffs and slower growth squeeze Lane County businesses\nEugene City Council unanimously recommends the pause of Flock cameras\nMore in community-news\nHousing-affordability advocates urge city official to enact opportunity to purchase act\nEugene Planning Commission backs code changes allowing taller new UO dorms in East Campus\nVolunteer groups hope to bridge gaps between UO and Eugene community\nACLU lawsuit against Eugene renews debate over police surveillance\nHouse fire across from UO residence hall\nSeven arrested in burglary ring after shelter-in-place notice\nMore in Features\nPhotos: The No. 5 University of Oregon Ducks take on West Coast rivals the No. 19 USC Trojans winning 42-27\nUO history professor arraigned on 10 charges of encouraging child sex-abuse in the first degree\nNo. 7 Oregon football downs No. 15 USC 42-27 in top-15 shootout\nLive updates: No. 7 Oregon beats No. 15 USC, 42-27, in final regular-season home game\nUO professor arrested on child sex-abuse charges\nUO legal counsel explains ICE protocols and legal boundaries during faculty senate meeting\nAbout the Contributor\nBillie Corsetti, News Reporter\nBillie is a news reporter at the Daily Emerald and a sophomore studying Journalism and Political Science.
