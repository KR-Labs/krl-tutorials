Their message to lawmakers was blunt: the state can\u2019t build affordable housing on exploited labor.\n\n\u201cThis is happening in all four corners of the state,\u201d said Miguel Fuentes, president of Local 326 and a representative for the North Atlantic States Regional Council of Carpenters. He said out-of-state developers and contractors, from as far as Florida, are profiting from community redevelopment funds and tax abatements while cutting corners on labor.\n\n\u201cThey decide they\u2019re going to build these projects on the cheap and not pay workers\u2019 time, not pay unemployment, not pay workers\u2019 comp, and not pay wages,\u201d he said.\n\nThe demonstration coincided with the Senate\u2019s special session to advance a housing bill designed to expand the state\u2019s rental stock through zoning incentives, streamlined permitting, and new development subsidies. The House approved the bill Wednesday.\u00a0\n\nWhile the proposal aims to accelerate construction, it contains no provisions addressing wage theft or labor misclassification \u2014 an omission unions say could undercut affordability goals before construction begins.\n\nFuentes said wage theft and misclassification have surged over the past two decades, particularly on publicly supported housing projects.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got skilled Connecticut workers ready to go, but contractors bring in out-of-state crews they can exploit. It drains wages and stability from our communities,\u201d he said.\n\nRecent enforcement actions show the pattern. In East Hartford, three principals of ITO Construction and Hotel Renovation Solutions were arrested after investigators found they paid workers in cash and misclassified them on a Fairfield Marriott project.\u00a0\n\nIn Meriden, subcontractors for A.R. Building Company drew eight stop-work orders after 50 workers went unpaid for nearly two months\u2014roughly $150,000 in stolen wages\u2014before one carpenter was killed on site.\n\nIn New Haven, the Labor Department halted work at Spinnaker Real Estate\u2019s 34 Fair Street development for misclassifying employees. In Bridgeport and Hartford, inspectors cited contractors for payroll and insurance violations at major redevelopment projects.\n\n\u201cThese are real jobs, real violations, and taxpayers end up footing the bill,\u201d Fuentes said.\n\nA recent advisory from the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network flagged construction as a high-risk industry for money laundering, tax fraud, and human trafficking. Construction workers, already struggling to make ends meet, are especially vulnerable.\n\nA UC Berkeley Labor Center study found 39% of Connecticut construction-worker families rely on public assistance. Misclassification drains thousands of dollars per worker in lost payroll taxes.\n\nNationally, between 1.1 and 2.1 million construction workers are misclassified or paid off the books each year \u2014 costing more than $12 billion in stolen wages and up to $10 billion in lost tax revenue.\n\nFuentes said unions have pushed stronger enforcement tools for three sessions, and lawmakers have begun to take notice. Earlier this year, Comptroller Sean Scanlon backed a bill that would allow his office to withhold payments from state contractors found violating wage laws after a 2024 audit uncovered nearly 1,000 wage-theft complaints stalled at the Department of Labor. The Senate approved the measure, but it died without a House vote before the 2025 session ended.\n\n\u201cIf there is a company that\u2019s shortchanging workers, we\u2019re gonna shortchange them,\u201d Scanlon reportedly said at the time.\u00a0\n\nUnion leaders are also pressing for contractor-liability legislation \u2014 already in place in 10 states \u2014 that would hold general contractors responsible for wage theft committed by subcontractors, suggesting a proposal that would apply to private projects with at least 15 units and include a 30-day window to correct violations without affecting municipalities.\n\n\u201cIf we want real affordability, everyone has to play by the rules,\u201d Fuentes said. \u201cConnecticut workers should earn enough to live in the homes they build. Do it right, and we fix problems. Do it wrong, and we multiply them.\u201d\n\nRELATED\nLamont: \u2018I Look Forward To Signing\u2019 New CT Housing Bill Into Law\nKeep reading\nby Donald Eng\nNovember 14, 2025, 2:44 pm\nCT Senate To Take Up Housing, Hospital Bills In Special Session Today\nKeep reading\nby Donald Eng\nNovember 13, 2025, 5:00 am\nRevised CT Housing Bill Clears House After 7-Hour Debate\nKeep reading\nby Donald Eng\nNovember 12, 2025, 3:38 pm\nMassachusetts Considers Expanding Effort To Ban Gas In New Buildings\nKeep reading\nby Sarah Shemkus for Canary Media\nNovember 12, 2025, 4:45 am\nConnecticut\u2019s Disappearing Farmland And What It Means For The Future\nKeep reading\nby Brian Scott-Smith\nNovember 11, 2025, 9:00 am\nCT\u2019s New Housing Proposal Heads To Special Legislative Session\nKeep reading\nby Karla Ciaglo\nNovember 10, 2025, 5:00 am\nWith Homelessness Rising, CT Earmarks $8M To Help People Stay Warm\nKeep reading\nby Donald Eng\nOctober 10, 2025, 5:00 am\nUConn Students Face Housing Crunch As Enrollment Rises\nKeep reading\nby Julia Gillego, University of Connecticut / CT Community News\nOctober 9, 2025, 12:10 pm\nTagged:400pThursday,\u00a0affordable housing,\u00a0eng,\u00a0Extra,\u00a0Push,\u00a0Sean Scanlon,\u00a0State Senate,\u00a0wages\nSPONSORED MESSAGES\n\nConnecticut Construction Industries Association \u2013 Shaping the Future of the Construction Industry\n\nOUR DIRECTORY PARTNERS\n\n\u00a9 2025 Your trusted, authentic, locally owned and operated news source at the state Capitol since 2005\nPowered by Newspack\nTerms of Service & Privacy Policy", "extraction_method": "jina", "word_count": 1062, "success": true}
