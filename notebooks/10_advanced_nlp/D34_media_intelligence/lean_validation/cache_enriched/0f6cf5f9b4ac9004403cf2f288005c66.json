Wes Moore signed Housing Starts Here executive order. \nMaryland faces a 96,000-unit housing deficit statewide. \nInitiative targets faster housing permits and state land use. \nPlan promotes transit-oriented development to cut costs.  \n  \nGov. Wes Moore signed an executive order on Sept. 3 aimed at tackling Maryland\u2019s escalating housing affordability crisis. The Housing Starts Here initiative seeks to expedite housing development, reduce production delays and make home ownership more accessible across the state. \nAccording to the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), the state faces a deficit of around 96,000 housing units \u2013 a gap that has been widening over recent years.\n \n    \nThe 2025 Maryland Housing Needs Assessment, an analysis of Maryland\u2019s housing gap conducted by DHCD and The National Center for Smart Growth, reveals significant disparities in housing availability across the state. Counties like Montgomery and Howard have median home prices exceeding $600,000, making homeownership unattainable for low and middle income residents. \nConversely, areas such as Allegany and Wicomico counties report median home prices below $200,000, which indicates regional inconsistencies in the Maryland housing market. \nThe executive order will broadly target each county in Maryland in order to create more housing development throughout the state.\n \n    \n\u201c[The executive order] says that everybody has a piece of the housing crisis, and everybody deserves for their local and state governments to be working in concert to solve that crisis,\u201d DHCD Secretary Jake Day said. \nIn more than half of Maryland counties, renters are spending more than one-third of their annual income on housing costs, which is considered unaffordable by federal standards. \nWhile Maryland\u2019s median income is 28% higher than the national median, the state\u2019s median home price is 35% higher, highlighting the disproportionate cost of housing. \n\u201cHow we got here is really the post-2008 financial crisis. It was real-estate driven\u2026 that had to do with risks that the financial industry took at the time,\u201d Secretary Day said. \u201cIt led to a collapse in the economy, in residential home values and more. The over-correction of the market meant we stopped building houses at a pace that matched population growth.\u201d \nThe Housing Starts Here Executive Order directs state agencies to identify underutilized state-owned properties suitable for transit-oriented development, aiming to increase housing density in areas with existing infrastructure. \nTransit-oriented development is a strategy that promotes dense, mixed-use communities around transit to help increase ridership and the use of public transportation. \n\u201cThere are a lot of benefits to it\u2026 we want to develop state-owned land for transit-oriented development, since state-owned land is not currently taxable. There\u2019s no revenue generation for the states or local jurisdictions. It also provides an opportunity for Marylanders to live closer to transit and use it more,\u201d Maryland Department of Transportation\u2019s Chief of Real Estate and Transit-Oriented Development, David Zaidain, said. \nAccording to Zaidain, transportation is the second biggest household budget item behind housing. It costs roughly $600 a month for Marylanders to own a car, which is pushing the state towards more transit usage. \nZaidain also noted the climate change benefits that come with transit-oriented development. \nThe executive order directs the state to speed up timelines for housing permits and establish a state housing ombudsman, or overseer, to help projects move forward. \nThe legislation comes on the heels of a 2024 legislative package that made housing more affordable and accessible for Marylanders struggling with construction barriers, along with creating the Office of Tenant and Landlord Affairs. \nThe Housing Starts Here order also directs agencies to track housing production progress annually, coordinate with local governments to address regional shortages and ensure accountability across jurisdictions. \nBy centralizing oversight and removing barriers, the administration aims to close the housing deficit and expand affordable options for Marylanders in the years ahead. \n\u201cWhen regulatory processes add cost, that cost has to be recouped \u2013 either with higher rents or a higher sales price. So, the more regulatory burden we place, the more likely it is that we\u2019re just producing expensive [places] for people to live,\u201d Secretary Day said. \u201cBy cutting time and money out of the process, by streamlining it, we can make it easier to get to the finish line.\u201d \n   \n \nTags: Development, housing, affordable housing, Wes Moore, Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development, Jake Day, Real Estate, Transportation, maryland economy, public transportation \n    \n \nRelated Articles \n \nMoore, Metro select firm for North Bethesda redevelopment \nState Center redevelopment enters new phase as search for consultants begins \nMoore signs order aimed at expanding affordable housing: \u2018We need to move faster\u2019 \nMD announces $36.8M toward affordable housing initiative \nBaltimore neighborhood first to receive UPLIFT funds for quality affordable housing    \n \n \nShare this! \n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n\nRelated Content\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMD-based Sinclair submits bid to buy out E.W.
