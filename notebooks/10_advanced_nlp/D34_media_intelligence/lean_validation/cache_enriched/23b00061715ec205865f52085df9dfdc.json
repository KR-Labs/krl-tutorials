{"full_text": "Alabama\u2019s housing market is splitting. Lower-priced homes are selling briskly, while higher-end listings linger, according to the latest HW Data.\nAffordable homes fuel pending sales\nAlabama\u2019s entry-level homes are moving quickly. The state recorded 1,843 pending sales in its most affordable tier last week at a median price of $165,000 \u2014 well below the national entry-level median of $215,000. These lower-priced homes went under contract in a median of 42 days, a week faster than Alabama\u2019s overall pending average of 49 days.\nActive inventory builds as higher-end homes linger\nAcross all price ranges, Alabama had 16,275 active single-family real estate listings last week with a median list price of $333,400. Homes still on the market carried a median age of 84 days, highlighting how higher-priced properties are moving more slowly.\nPending sales data reflects how quickly homes go under contract, while listings data shows the age of inventory still on the market. Together, they highlight both buyer activity and seller challenges.\nThe Altos Market Action Index registered 33, a level that generally favors sellers. The index compares the current rate of sales to available inventory, with 30 considered a balanced market. Higher numbers tilt toward sellers, while lower numbers tilt toward buyers. Still, Alabama\u2019s longer listing times at higher price points suggest the seller\u2019s edge isn\u2019t universal.\nA divided market\nThe data points to two different realities. Budget-conscious buyers are driving activity in affordable segments, where homes sell faster and at lower prices. Sellers above the median price are facing longer timelines and more competition, often needing more attractive pricing to secure offers.\nWhat\u2019s next\nAlabama\u2019s housing market remains resilient, but the divide is widening. Affordable homes continue to sell quickly, while higher-end properties test seller patience.\nNationally, the same pattern is emerging as affordable homes drive demand while pricier listings cool. Alabama\u2019s numbers mirror that divide, showing continued strength in affordable segments and slower movement at the higher end.\nRelated\nMore:\nAffordability\nAlabama\nArtificial Intelligence\nHousing Market Data", "extraction_method": "beautifulsoup", "word_count": 329, "success": true}
