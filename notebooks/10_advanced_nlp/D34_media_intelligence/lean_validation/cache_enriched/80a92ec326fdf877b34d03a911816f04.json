They note in a 108-page Greater Boston Housing Report Card 2025 released by The Boston Foundation and Boston Indicators on Nov. 12. that home prices and rents have flattened in 2025 but are still \u201chistorically\u201d high.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to get lost in the numbers of units, permits, and cost burdens, but we must remind ourselves that at the end of the day, we are talking about real homes, families and communities,\u201d Lee Pelton, CEO and president of the foundation, said in a statement.\n\n\nWhile the gap between those who can afford to live in the Greater Boston area and those who can\u2019t continues to widen, \u201cthese trends are not inevitable,\u201d Pelton said during the event where the report was unveiled. \u201cThey reflect choices, policy choices, investment choices and collective priorities that we have the power to change,\u201d he said.\n\n\nThe annual income a household needs to afford an \u201centry-level\u201d home rose from about $98,000 in 2021 to more than $162,000 in 2025, assuming a 3.5 percent down payment, according to the report. This trend is squeezing renters out of making the leap to home ownership. Just 15 percent of renter households can afford an \u201centry-level\u201d home \u2013 down from 30 percent in 2021.\n\n\n\u201cThe data show just how much work we have to do if we are to expand opportunities and unfreeze the market,\u201d Luc Schuster, executive director of Boston Indicators, TBF\u2019s research arm, said in a statement.\n\n\nRenters continue to face stiff prices.\n\n\nThe Greater Boston area has the fifth most expensive rental market in the country in 2025, according to the report, which cited the Zillow Observed Rent Index that tracks changes in market rents across housing types.\n\n\nNew York, San Jose, San Francisco and San Diego were the only four markets with higher rental prices than Boston. In September 2025, the ZORI found rent for the Boston area was almost $3,000 per month, not including other housing costs like heat, electricity, and water.\n\n\nRents across all neighborhoods within Boston metro core communities have risen since 2022, but increases slowed in some areas since 2024. Also, more than half of renters in Greater Boston are \u201ccost-burdened,\u201d meaning they spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing. More than one-quarter of renters spend more than 50 percent of their income on rent, meaning they are considered \u201cseverely cost-burdened.\u201d Renters of color are cost burdened at higher levels, according to the report.\n\n\nThe report also noted that the rates of \u201ccost-burdened\u201d and \u201cseverely cost-burdened\u201d may be overstated because the estimates \u2013 based on American Community Survey data \u2013 might inflate the cost burden for those in subsidized housing. Still, many in the region face affordability pressures.\n\n\nA shortage of rental units in Boston is one of the main drivers for the city\u2019s high rent prices. While vacancy rates across most major US cities have fallen in the past two decades, Boston\u2019s was particularly low \u2013 just 3 percent in 2024. However, the report noted there are early indicators that vacancy rates may be rising in some neighborhoods with more students, likely because of a drop in international student enrollment under President Donald J. Trump\u2019s immigration policies.\n\n\nCensus Address Counts, a dataset from the Census Bureau tracking a list of addresses, show that the Greater Boston area created more than 70,000 homes since 2020, marking a steady increase, according to the report.\n\n\nBut, the best available data on new construction permits, which are seen as a key indicator for future housing construction, have dropped. As of July 2025, the number of new permits issued are 44 percent below the levels for the same period in 2021. High construction costs and interest rates have made funding projects more difficult and are a key cause of the slowdown, especially when compounded with existing barriers like restrictive zoning, costly building code requirements, and lengthy approval processes, according to the report.\n\n\nThe study noted that declining permitting doesn\u2019t bode well for Gov. Healey\u2019s goal of constructing 220,000 additional homes in the state between 2025 and 2035. Since she took office in 2023, 90,400 homes have been \u201ccompleted, started construction, or proposed,\u201d according to the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities.\n\n\nWhile it looks like the state is making progress on its goal, most of the 90,400 homes were built or permitted before 2025. If the pace of completions between 2023 and 2025 is kept up, Massachusetts would be on track to meet its goal of building 220,000 homes by 2035. But at the current pace of permitting, it\u2019s unlikely the state will meet its goal.\n\n\nMany of the homes recently completed were projects that were likely financed with \u201chistorically low\u201d interest rates in the 2010s and 2020s, according to the report. Now, with more tariffs on building materials, workforce challenges and higher borrowing costs, getting projects financed is more difficult.\n\n\nThere are a lot of \u201cintractable\u201d challenges within government, but housing shouldn\u2019t be one of them, said Lt. Gov. Kimberley Driscoll, during an event where the report was unveiled.\n\n\n\u201dIt should not be as hard as it is,\u201d she said, adding that it\u2019s important for local and state officials as well as housing developers and communities to work together.\n\n\nHomelessness hit record high levels in 2024 and dipped slightly in early 2025. However, the report noted that most recent available data was collected in January and may not reflect more recent shifts. Also, emergency assistance caseloads have dropped \u201cdramatically\u201d in 2025 \u2013 falling by almost half from January to July, according to the report, which said questions remain about whether those who exited shelters secured permanent housing or fell back into homelessness.\n\n\nThe report noted several moves by state leaders that contributed to this drop, including capping the shelter system to 4,000 families in July, a move that will take effect Dec. 31.\u00a0 On Aug. 1, the governor also ended the state of emergency she declared in 2023 and closed all remaining hotel shelters.\n\n\nThe report also included a section with research by the Boston University Initiative on Cities on what communities have done to meet requirements outlined in the MBTA Communities Act. The section also includes a case study on how Lexington, Needham, and Wellesley responded to the law.\n\n\nThe act requires 177 cities and towns in the MBTA service area to change their zoning and land use policies to allow for construction of more housing \u2013 without requiring more housing to get built. The law has received a lot of media attention over controversy surrounding communities working on creating compliant plans.\n\n\nEach community has had its own approach to complying with the law, and each faced many options. This year to date, the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities has approved plans for 106 municipalities. Another 56 communities are in conditional or interim compliance \u2013 meaning their processes are in progress or submissions are under review. Also, 15 communities with deadlines in July 2025 were not compliant as of Sept. 5. and 27 communities have deadlines in December, according to the report.\n\n\nDriscoll said the law has been a \u201csource of inspiration and at times a source of frustration.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nState House News Service\nAll articles\n\nRecent News\n\nSt. Mary\u2019s Center launches fundraising effort for new facility that will double unit numbers\nThe mayor\u2019s on board for better schools.
