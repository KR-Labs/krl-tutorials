Francesca Hong\u2019s run for governor. Her platform advocates for affordable housing, a $23 minimum wage by 2030, no-cost child and health care and full funding for the Wisconsin public schooling system.  \n  \n  \n      \nBennett served on the Madison Common Council for two terms from April 2021 to April 2025.  \nShe joins an open Democratic primary where the party has had an unbroken hold on the 76th assembly district seat since 2013. She\u2019s competing against a current Common Council member vying for the seat\u2014 Dina Nina Martinez-Rutherford. \nWhile her political experience has shaped her understanding of government, Bennett\u2019s personal experiences have played an equally significant role in motivating her to serve. Bennett\u2019s advocacy for cheaper medical care started with medical debt her family experienced as she finished her degree in 2022 from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  \nHer father had fallen into cardiac arrest with a 6% chance of survival, it was made clear that it would take a miracle for Bennett's father to pull through. Thankfully, through the tireless efforts of medical staff, he did. However, while her father may have won a large battle with his health, there existed another battle entirely: the medical bill.  \nWith the costs totaling some $500,000 and an eviction looming on the horizon, Bennett saw firsthand the significant impact the state\u2019s laws had on the well-being of its people.  \nThe experience not only motivated her to become an alder twice and pass local ordinances that aligned with her goals in Madison, but also inspired her to announce her current campaign for state assembly, where Bennett could extend her influence throughout Wisconsin. \n  \n  \n      \n\u201cI really saw the personal impact of how our state laws are really prohibitive on the general public, and there's only so much you can do as an alder when the state has hamstrung every single thing that we could do to help people,\u201d Bennett told The Daily Cardinal. \nBennett said students could be one of the  largest populations to benefit from her policies, as she aims to improve the financial and housing prospects of being a college student in Wisconsin, especially at UW-Madison. \nFully funding the Wisconsin public education system ultimately depends on how dollars are earned and allocated within the state assembly. To increase earnings, Bennett  believes in revisiting previous avenues, such as taxing income rather than just property taxes. Other areas of investment, such as spending on incarceration, could also be significantly reduced to reinvest in public schools. \nBennett is also in support of the Wisconsin Tuition Promise, a \u2018last dollar\u2019 tuition program the University of Wisconsin System instituted in 2023, paused and reinstituted in 2025 that covers any remaining costs of attendance for those whose families earn under the median Wisconsin income.  \n \n  Enjoy what you're reading?

We just need to build more homes. Wisconsin is in a shortage of 200,000 affordable homes, and we currently don't have a plan to get there.\u201d \nHowever, Bennett foresees an obstacle. She criticized Democrats, saying her own party lacks a clear consensus on issues relating to equal rights for women, transgender people and people of color.  \n\u201cI think that we need to have real come-to-Jesus moments within our party, and from the things that I'm hearing from residents and students and young people in Madison, it\u2019s that we're tired of our elected leaders kind of selling us out,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cI think that there is a real issue of where our leaders, in the aura of trying to compromise, have become compromised themselves.\u201d \nReflecting on her time as a student activist at UW-Madison and her involvement in student government through the Associated Students of Madison, Bennett said her student experience shaped her desire to become the change she wanted to see in her party. \nThis is why Bennett wants to reinstate the right to shared governance. ASM does not possess nearly as much power as it once did, Bennett explained, with much of its previous power having been relegated to the chancellor.  \nBennett said her journey from student activist to city alder to state assembly candidate underscores a commitment to turning personal struggle into public action.  \n\u201cYou deserve a representative who has been in your shoes and fought for your needs. I will be that representative,\u201d she said. \nParty primary election will take place on Aug. 11, with the Democratic candidate likely to win the seat on Nov. 3, 2026 in the heavily-Democratic district.
