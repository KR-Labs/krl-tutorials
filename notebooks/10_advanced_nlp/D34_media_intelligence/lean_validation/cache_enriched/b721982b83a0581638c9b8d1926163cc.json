The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called \u201clock-in effect,\u201d where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.\nMany homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don\u2019t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.\n\n\n\nHomes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.\n\n\n\n\u201cBuyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they\u2019re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,\u201d Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. \u201cOthers aren\u2019t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put\u2014either because they\u2019re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.\u201d\n\n\n\nAllowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.\nBut it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today\u2019s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.\n\u201cAnyone able to \u2018port\u2019 a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today\u2019s higher rates\u2014only now with even higher list prices,\u201d Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.\nPortable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.\nPulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller\u2019s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.\nThe 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.\n\n\n\nThe administration\u2019s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.\nA shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.\nHousing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.\nTariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.\n\nREAD THE COMMENTS (1)\nTariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrending\n\n\nVirginia high school football coach Travis Turner goes missing amid undefeated season\nA high school football coach has gone missing in the middle of an undefeated season in Virginia.\n\nMan arrested after shooting and injuring 1 in Amherst County: Sheriff Ayers\nSheriff Ayers held a press conference on Monday to release details regarding a malicious wounding in Amherst County.\n\nGynecologist who worked at multiple hospitals accused of recording, touching 50 patients\nA gynecologist who worked at multiple hospitals was accused by over 50 patients of secretly recording and inappropriately touching them.\n\n\n\n\n\n2 injuries reported after accident, Altavista fire crews say\nAltavista fire crews said two injuries were reported after an accident on Sunday.\n\nVicious fight aboard Metrobus in Fairfax County leaves man in critical condition\nA Metrobus ride turned violent Saturday after an argument escalated into a brutal beating, leaving a man hospitalized in critical but stable condition. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEWS IN PHOTOS:\"Local\"\n\n\n3\nMan arrested after shooting and injuring 1 in Amherst County: Sheriff Ayers\n\n7\nThanksgiving cooking safety tips: how to prevent kitchen fires this holiday season\n\n3\n2 injuries reported after accident, Altavista fire crews say\n\n4\nFamilies gather in Downtown Lynchburg for Bright Nights and festive holiday cheer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nACCESSIBILITY\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload Our Mobile Apps:\n\n\n\n\nTerms & Conditions\nCopyright Notices\nEEO Public File Report\nFCC Info\nFCC Applications\nPublic File Assistance\nContact\nNews Team\nCareers\nContests\n\n\nNews\nWeather\nSports\nGame Center\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nDo Not Sell or Share\n\nCookie Preferences\n\n\n\n\n 2025 Sinclair, Inc.", "extraction_method": "jina", "word_count": 1873, "success": true}
