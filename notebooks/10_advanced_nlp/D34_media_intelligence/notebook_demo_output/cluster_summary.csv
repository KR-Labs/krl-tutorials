And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk.

Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.\nThe Bottom Line\nBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.\n\nBE THE FIRST TO COMMENT\nMeanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.\n\nTrending\n\nOne person airlifted after fight at Glenbrook Apartments in Cedar Rapids Sunday night\nOne individual was airlifted to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics following a fight at Glendbrook Apartments on Sunday night.The incident occurred j\n\nCrab House opens in Coralville, serving seafood lovers daily\nA new seafood spot is now open in Coralville.Crab House Seafood Boil and Bar officially opened its doors Saturday, Nov. 22.The restaurant is open daily from 1\n\nWEEKEND SNOW?

The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.TrendingFairfield man charged with making terrorist threat, held on $109,000 bondA Fairfield man is facing several charges, including making a terrorist threat.40-year-old Phillip Earl Allen, Jr., is being held in the Jefferson County Jail.Sylva man arrested for setting woman on fire during domestic dispute A Sylva man has been arrested after setting a woman on fire during a domestic violence incident.Woman convicted in Slender Man stabbing taken into custody in IllinoisAn effort to find Geyser began Saturday after police say she cut off her monitoring bracelet and left her group home.Sunshine and dry conditions stick around for the start of the holiday weekThe Thanksgiving holiday is right around the corner, but before all the feasting and family fun, we have a few more days of work.uckily for those in northern NeUber driver allegedly attacked with plastic grocery bag during delivery in south AustinPolice arrested a man last Tuesday for allegedly putting a plastic groceyr bag over an Uber delivery driver\'s head in south Austin.The arrest affidavit says thaNEWS IN PHOTOS:""Local""5Sunshine and dry conditions stick around for the start of the holiday week6Sunshine and cool temperatures to close out weekend in Greater Reno Area6Beautiful, sunny conditions return to northern Nevada to kick off the weekend3Eastbound I-80 reopens near Donner Summit, chains in effect on other mountain passesACCESSIBILITYTerms & ConditionsCopyright NoticesEEO Public File ReportFCC InfoFCC ApplicationsPublic File AssistanceContactNews TeamCareersContestsNewsWeatherSportsTrafficGame CenterPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyDo Not Sell or ShareCookie Preferencestwitter iconfacebook icon 2025 Sinclair, Inc.', 'Trump administration tries to break through lock-in effect with \'portable mortgages\'NewsNewsBiltmore Village McDonald\'s to unveil new grand piano as reopening nearsOne of the most unique fast food locations in the country is inching closer to reopening after it was devastated by hurricane floodwaters in September 2024.North Carolina Gov.

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40.

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40.

(TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home.

But while homes everywhere are becoming less affordable, the problem is actually accelerating faster in rural areas, according to new analysis by Redfin. When Kristin Fuerstenberg bought her cabin in northern, rural Wisconsin five years ago, it was supposed to be a part-time thing. But she loved the change of scenery.“I wake up every day, I look out at a lake, and you can't beat that,” she said.Like a lot of people who bought in the area around the time of the pandemic, she stuck around. She’s a realtor there in Oneida County and said, even now, inventory is low and prices are high. Take the home she sold earlier this year: “3 bedroom, 1 bath little ranch. $350,000. And prior to 2021, that house probably would have been $170,000.” Housing everywhere is less affordable, but in rural areas —\xa0like where Fuerstenberg lives — the affordability crisis is accelerating fastest, per Chen Zhao, head of economics research at Redfin.“Rural buyers, they have to earn about $75,000 in order to afford the typical home, and that is double what they needed to earn before the pandemic,” she said. Income has only gone up 33% in rural areas. Colorado realtor Dana Cottrell is seeing this play out in communities outside big ski destinations in the Rockies.“When you get priced out of maybe the bigger resorts, you tend to look a little further afield, and then what happens to the people that are living there, to the ranches, it becomes harder and harder for people to afford their local areas,” she said.On the flip side, Cottrell said, for those who were able to get into homes five years ago, that investment is paying off.Related TopicsCollections:HousingTagged as:Housinghousing affordabilityrural areascovid-19 pandemicOur best stories, straight to your inbox"", 'A new proposal has been pitched in the United States to address the country’s housing crisis. The Trump administration is working to introduce 50-year mortgage terms for homebuyers.Instead of the standard 30-year fixed mortgage, payments would be spread across 50 years.President Trump has framed it as a continuation of the American Dream, likening it to Franklin Roosevelt’s introduction of the 30-year mortgage.Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte has called the plan a “game changer”.AdvertisementSince the principal would be amortised over a longer period, monthly repayments would be reduced, making repayments appear more affordable to first homebuyers. As a result, younger buyers and renters would be able to enter the housing market despite high prices and interest rates.However, analysts warn that lower monthly repayments would inflate demand, pushing home prices even higher. Economists caution that the policy would worsen affordability rather than solve it.Buyers could also still be repaying mortgages well into their 70s or 80s, making it a lifetime mortgage.AdvertisementHere in Australia, several lenders have recently begun offering 40-year mortgages, some of which are solely for first home buyers.One-third of Australian adults polled by Finder said they’d take out a 40-year home loan if it meant lower monthly payments.Canstar estimated that an individual on a median full-time wage is eligible to borrow up to $24,000 more on a 40-year mortgage than on a 30-year mortgage, while a couple working full-time can borrow up to $48,000 more.AdvertisementThe following chart from Alex Joiner at IFM Investors illustrates how a lengthier 40-year mortgage term increases borrowing capacity.Longer loan terms lower monthly repayments, but lifetime repayment costs grow, and more Australians will carry mortgage debt into retirement.AdvertisementThe reality is that these types of mortgage reforms will exacerbate the housing crisis and ultimately hinder financial stability and affordability.Australia already has one of the most expensive housing markets in the world relative to our economy and household incomes.AdvertisementAllowing households to borrow more for their homes would achieve the same thing it usually does: increase debt levels and long-term housing costs.This century has supplied abundant empirical evidence for how the story will conclude. Home prices and mortgage debt will be pushed to new heights.AdvertisementThe last thing that overvalued housing markets need is more mortgage fuel being poured on the bonfire.', 'Real Estate Published\nNovember 20, 2025 11:49am EST\nHousing affordability crisis hammering rural America Pandemic-era price surge leaves rural homebuyers needing double the income from 2019\nFacebook Twitter Comments Print Email Add Fox Business on Google\nBy\nDaniella Genovese\nFOXBusiness\nclose\nvideo Trump admin suggests \'portable mortgages\' to fix housing crisis \'The Big Money Show\' panel discusses Federal housing official Bill Pulte floating the idea of \'portable mortgages\' to incentivize selling homes and revitalizing the declining housing market.

In rural America, prices continue to rise and incomes haven\'t kept up, according to a new report from Redfin. The convergence of both factors is causing housing affordability to ""erode faster than big cities and suburbs.""\xa0Homeowners need an annual income of $74,508 to afford a median-priced home in rural U.S. counties, up a staggering 105.8% from before the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, rural buyers only needed to earn $36,206, according to Redfin\'s analysis, which compares the third quarter of 2025 with the third quarter of 2019. \xa0 MORE THAN HALF OF US HOMES LOST VALUE OVER THE LAST YEAR The income needed to afford a median-priced home in suburban counties rose 90.9% to $102,120 during that same period. Previously, potential buyers only needed an annual salary of $53,482. The income needed to afford a home in urban counties climbed 87.5% to $118,300.

But during the pandemic, areas gained a lot of out-of-state prospective homebuyers. For instance, New Hampshire saw a growing interest from buyers in New York, Texas, California and Seattle, often with larger budgets. This allowed sellers to drive up the asking price, win bidding wars and purchase properties in the Lakes Region, according to New Hampshire-based Redfin Premier real estate agent Julia Martinage.""A lot of those people are now moving back to where they came from and being replaced by locals or people from border states like Massachusetts,"" Martinage said.\nU.S. Stock Market Quotes\nArrives Weekly\nGet Our Newsletter\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\nWe\'ve added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking', 'Fact Check Team Will Trumps 50 Year Mortgage Idea Solve Or Worsen Housing Affordability Delay Americ', 'The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA)’s Purchase Applications Payment Index (PAPI) for October showed that homebuyer affordability improved for the fifth consecutive month, with the national median payment applied for by purchase applicants decreasing to $2,039 — down from $2,067 in September.\nMBA‘s PAPI measures how new monthly mortgage payments vary across time, relative to income, using data from the trade group’s Weekly Applications Survey.\nEdward Seiler, MBA’s associate vice president of housing economics and executive director of the Research Institute for Housing America, said that the streak of improved affordability conditions is tied to lower mortgage rates, higher household earnings and flattening home-price growth.\n“The median purchase application payment amount in October was $88 lower than one year ago. Affordability is improving — PAPI is at its lowest level since March 2022— and is likely to continue to as mortgage rates hold to around 6% and more supply comes onto the market,” Seiler said.\nAn increase in MBA’s PAPI indicates declining borrower affordability conditions, and that the mortgage payment-to-income ratio is higher due to increasing application loan amounts, rising mortgage rates or a decrease in earnings.\nConversely, a decrease in the PAPI indicates improving borrower affordability conditions and occurs when loan application amounts decrease, mortgage rates decrease or earnings increase.\nThe national PAPI fell 1.6% to a reading of 152.0 in October, down from 155.0 in September, reflecting a 4.2% drop in typical mortgage payments. And earnings growth pushed affordability up 5.5% on an annual basis.\nFor borrowers applying for lower-payment mortgages, at the 25th percentile, the national payment fell to $1,402, down from $1,418 the previous month.\nThe national median mortgage payment in October was $2,039, down $28 from September and $88 lower than a year earlier. Federal Housing Administration\xa0(FHA) borrowers saw their median monthly payment dip slightly to $1,789, compared to $1,792 in September and $1,842 in October 2024.\nConventional loan applicants, meanwhile, reported a median payment of $2,063, down from $2,105 the month prior and $2,134 a year earlier.\nThe states with the highest PAPI readings — meaning the least affordable markets — were Idaho (238.0), Nevada (230.7), Rhode Island (199.4), Arizona (198.6) and Tennessee (192.8). The most affordable markets were Louisiana (113.5), Connecticut (116.2), Washington, D.C. (118.6), Hawaii (123.6) and North Dakota (124.9).\nAffordability improved across demographic groups.

(TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)Comment on this story0CommentShare storySharetopics: Mortgage ratesPortable mortgagesHousing affordabilityLock-in effectHomeownershipHousing supplyMortgage-backed securitiesTariffsWASHINGTON (TNND) — The Trump administration is considering another method to bring down soaring housing costs through mortgage rates that are pricing people out of homeownership and keeping homes from coming onto the market.Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating “portable mortgages,” which would allow homebuyers to take their mortgage rate with them when they decide to move. The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.Trending8 inmates face charges after 2 inmates attacked at Hamilton County JailSeveral inmates at the Hamilton County Jail have been charged after a stabbing incident that left two men hospitalized.Affidavits we obtained says deputies wereConfined dog shot, killed in Bradley County; Woman charged with aggravated animal crueltyA woman in Bradley County faces charges after deputies say she shot and killed a dog at a home on Sunday.Deputies responded to the home in the northeast part oMan charged with killing a deer illegally in ChattanoogaA Chattanooga man faces charges after a state game warden says he found evidence that he illegally shot and killed a deer over the weekend.An affidavit says autReport: Hamilton County deputies shot suspect who sped towards them with stolen vehicleWe\'re learning more from an affidavit about what led to 2 Hamilton County deputies shooting a suspectat a Chattanooga gas station early Saturday morning.The inFormer Tennessee lawmaker Robin Smith learns where she\'ll serve her prison sentenceFormer Hixson state lawmaker Robin Smith has learned where she will serve her federal prison sentence, even as her attorneys work to get her a pardon from PresiNEWS IN PHOTOS:""Local""5Pharmacist advises Georgians amid rising ACA healthcare costs without subsidy extension6Bradley Central homecoming queen\'s act of kindness bridges gap between shared struggles6Marjorie Taylor Greene\'s exit sparks questions about future of Georgia\'s 14th District3Judge denies new trial for Chattanooga man convicted in Market Street murder caseACCESSIBILITYDownload Our Mobile Apps:Terms & ConditionsCopyright NoticesEEO Public File ReportFCC Online Public FileFCC ApplicationsPublic File AssistanceContactNews TeamCareersContestsNewsWeatherSportsGame CenterPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyDo Not Sell or ShareCookie Preferencestwitter iconfacebook icon 2025 Sinclair, Inc.', 'News\n\nNews\n\nUS ready to launch more operations against Venezuela\nThe U.S. is ready to launch more operations against Venezuela this week, Reuters reported over the weekend.\n\nLizzo reveals she was \'suicidal\' at the beginning of her weight loss journey\nLizzo was in a low place at the start of her weight loss journey, feeling ""suicidal"" after a public scandal, all of which she channeled into healthier habits.\n\nTrump to visit Beijing in April, China\'s Xi invited for state visit next year\nThe phone call came nearly one month after the two men met in person for the first time in six years.\n\nFamily of woman killed in 12-car crash hold fundraiser to help with funeral costs\nThe family of a woman recently killed in a12-vehicle crash held a fundraiser to help with funeral costs.Adeline Duran Rincon was one of the two vicitms identif\n\nLocalNation & WorldEntertainmentVideosOffbeatSpecial ReportsPoliticsThings To DoPhoto GalleriesAmazing AmericaArmstrong Army StrongInside Your WorldSoarBeyond the PodiumQuestion of the DaySpotlight on AmericaAuto MattersHealthy HomeFull Measure with Sharyl AttkissonDid You Know?Addicted AmericaCrisis in the ClassroomARCFormula Vegas\nWeather\n\nCurrent Weather\n\nLas Vegas\nSunny\n\n61F\n\n66/\n46\n\nToday\n\n66/\n46\n\nTuesday\n\n69/\n45\n\nWednesday\n\n69/\n45\n\nLatest Weathercast\nLatest Weathercast\n\nMapsRadarHurricane TrackerWeather News3 Degree Guarantee\nFeatures\n\nFeatures\n\nUS ready to launch more operations against Venezuela\nThe U.S. is ready to launch more operations against Venezuela this week, Reuters reported over the weekend.\n\nLizzo reveals she was \'suicidal\' at the beginning of her weight loss journey\nLizzo was in a low place at the start of her weight loss journey, feeling ""suicidal"" after a public scandal, all of which she channeled into healthier habits.\n\nTrump to visit Beijing in April, China\'s Xi invited for state visit next year\nThe phone call came nearly one month after the two men met in person for the first time in six years.\n\nFamily of woman killed in 12-car crash hold fundraiser to help with funeral costs\nThe family of a woman recently killed in a12-vehicle crash held a fundraiser to help with funeral costs.Adeline Duran Rincon was one of the two vicitms identif\n\nConsumer ReportsMake A Wish MondayDrive Safe Las VegasSInclair CaresPartner SpotlightAround the WebFor Pet\'s SakeSpanish Closed CaptioningSmart Money MovesBreaking Down the LawJob ConnectionWho\'s Hiring?Research SpotlightAsk The ExpertsLocal LivingCooking with Chef JeffMental Health MattersYour Place Inside and OutLocally Owned Small BusinessesAsk the Experts: FinanceSouper Bowl of Caring\nTraffic\n\nTraffic\n\nGov.

""Housing was affordable for everyone and that has quickly changed in just the span of 20 years."" \n\nHow much do you need to make? (KSNV)\n\nHe noted that jobs in the area are not keeping pace with rising housing costs, making homeownership ""simply out of reach for most of the jobs in this town."" Irwin highlighted that a minimum wage worker now faces an ""impossible number of hours"" to afford a home, a situation exacerbated by pressures from West Coast housing markets. \n\nWhere does Las Vegas stack up? (KSNV)\n\nDespite Southern Nevada being one of the more affordable regions in the West, the influx of people from California is driving up demand without a corresponding increase in supply. \n\nIncomes among hospitality jobs (KSNV)\n\n""We are not building houses at the rate we used to,"" Irwin said, citing permitting, zoning, and federal land ownership issues as contributing factors. He warned that Las Vegas is nearing the unaffordability levels seen in California, which poses a significant challenge. \n\nLas Vegas: In Perspective (KSNV)\n\nFor prospective homebuyers, Irwin advised, ""It is just a matter of sometimes just getting lucky. Maybe buying a slightly smaller house with a smaller payment and hoping you can upgrade in the future."" However, he acknowledged that ""getting in is the tough part"" as entry prices continue to rise while wages lag behind.\n\nFannie Mae raises mortgage rate forecast amid tariff uncertainty (AP Photo/Jenny Kane)\n\nREAD THE COMMENTS (5)\nTo read the Lied Center for Real Estate report, click here.\n\nTrending\n\nAnother milestone reached in Athletics ballpark construction in Las Vegas\nA\'s team owner John Fisher and other dignitaries held a ceremonial groundbreaking for the ballpark back in June.\n\nPolice release body cam video of road-rage shooting that killed 11-year-old\nThe Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department has released body-camera videos showing the aftermath of a road-rage shooting that resulted in the death of 11-year\n\nLocal attorney shares why stepfather wasn\'t charged in 11-year-old boy\'sroad rage death\nThe community is demanding answers after an 11-year-old boy was shot and killed in a road rage incident in Henderson.The suspect , 22-year-old Tyler Matthew Joh\n\nNevadans reveal top three independent butchers for quality Thanksgiving turkeys\nAs Thanksgiving approaches, Nevadans have named their top three independent butchers in a recent poll conducted by MarketBeat, a financial media company.The su\n\nPedestrian dies after crash near Nellis, Sahara in east Las Vegas\nA man is dead after he was hit by a car while crossing a street in east Las Vegas on Sunday, according to police.The collision happened just after 5:50 p.m. on \n\nNEWS IN PHOTOS:""Local""\n\n3\nFamily of woman killed in 12-car crash hold fundraiser to help with funeral costs\n\n4\nFlamingo Las Vegas gears up for milestone anniversary with new hotel, casino renovations\n\n3\nAces\' Gray, Young lined up for Team USA training camp\n\n3\nNevada lawmakers want new hearings in Congress for potential nuclear testing\n\nACCESSIBILITY\n\nTerms & Conditions\nCopyright Notices\nEEO Public File Report\nPublic Inspection File\nFCC Applications\nPublic Inspection File Assistance\nContact Us\nContests\n\nNews\nWeather\nTraffic\nSports\nStation\nPolitics\nAround the Web\nGame Center\n\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nDo Not Sell or Share\n\nCookie Preferences\n\n 2025 Sinclair, Inc.']"

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.Comment with BubblesREAD THE COMMENTS (1)Meanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.TrendingTeen going 100 mph charged with killing pregnant girlfriend in deadly 12-vehicle crashA teenager, Jose Gutierrez, 19, is facing murder charges after allegedly causing a 12-vehicle crash while driving at 100 mph in a 45 mph zone.Family-run Reno stores hit by quick change scam more than 50 times since 2017A quick change scam, also known as a short change scam, is causing significant losses for a family-run business in northern Nevada.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)Comment on this story0CommentShare storySharetopics: Mortgage ratesPortable mortgagesHousing affordabilityLock-in effectHomeownershipHousing supplyMortgage-backed securitiesTariffsWASHINGTON (TNND) — The Trump administration is considering another method to bring down soaring housing costs through mortgage rates that are pricing people out of homeownership and keeping homes from coming onto the market.Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating “portable mortgages,” which would allow homebuyers to take their mortgage rate with them when they decide to move. The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.TrendingAnother milestone reached in Athletics ballpark construction in Las VegasA\'s team owner John Fisher and other dignitaries held a ceremonial groundbreaking for the ballpark back in June.Local attorney shares why stepfather wasn\'t charged in 11-year-old boy\'sroad rage deathThe community is demanding answers after an 11-year-old boy was shot and killed in a road rage incident in Henderson.The suspect , 22-year-old Tyler Matthew JohFamily of woman killed in 12-car crash hold fundraiser to help with funeral costsThe family of a woman recently killed in a12-vehicle crash held a fundraiser to help with funeral costs.Adeline Duran Rincon was one of the two vicitms identifPolice investigate shots fired in central Las Vegas neighborhoodAuthorities are investigating after a shooting was reported in a central Las Vegas neighborhood Monday morning.Police release body cam video of road-rage shooting that killed 11-year-oldThe Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department has released body-camera videos showing the aftermath of a road-rage shooting that resulted in the death of 11-yearNEWS IN PHOTOS:""Local""9Police: crime down in Spring Valley, but 89103 remains among top zip codes5Federal rule change could limit nursing student loan access4NV Energy warns customers of holiday scam spike3Red Rock to limit Scenic Drive, visitor center hours on Thanksgiving DayACCESSIBILITYTerms & ConditionsCopyright NoticesEEO Public File ReportPublic Inspection FileFCC ApplicationsPublic Inspection File AssistanceContact UsContestsNewsWeatherTrafficSportsStationPoliticsAround the WebGame CenterPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyDo Not Sell or ShareCookie Preferencestwitter iconfacebook icon 2025 Sinclair, Inc.', 'Fact Check Team: Will Trump\'s 50-year mortgage idea solve or worsen housing affordability?NewsNewsHanford police investigate alleged wire fraud at CajitamexThe Hanford Police Department is working on identifying all victims affected by alleged wire fraud from a local business.Detectives report of fraud and theft atTicket chaos at high school championship: spectators turned away despite valid ticketsA championship game drew thousands Friday night at Daren Kolligiant Stadium in Fresno friday nightBut many fans who bought tickets ahead of time say they neverFowler police seek the public\'s help to identify a man in Ace Hardware theftThe Fowler Police are asking the public to identify a man who stole a tool set from an Ace Hardware store.According to police, a man entered the Fowler Ace HardFresno County Sheriff\'s Office seeks help finding next of kin for Fresno manThe Fresno County Sheriff’s Office is asking the public\'s help in locating the next of kin of 67-year-old Raymond Coronado.Coronado is described to be 6 feet taAddicted\nin the ValleyAmazing AmericaArmstrong Army StrongBeyond The PodiumCalVotes 2024Connect to CongressCrimeCrisis in the ClassroomDid You Know?EntertainmentFOX26 News PollFull Measure with Sharyl AttkissonHealthy HomeInside Your WorldLocalLocal PoliticsMost WantedNation & WorldOffbeatOpinionQuestion of the DaySoarSpotlight on AmericaTrafficVideosState Election ResultsLocal Election ResultsWeatherCurrent WeatherFresnoFoggy49F56/43Today56/43Tuesday56/42Wednesday59/44Latest WeathercastLatest WeathercastMapsRadarSchool ClosingsSportsSportsFresno State football stunned by 2nd half surge from Utah StateFor the first two hours or so, everything went according to plan.27 Fresno State football seniors took their final jog into Valley Children\'s Stadium, many of tHigh school football: Central Section semifinal roundup; Fresno Christian wins 8-manWatch asFresno Christian secures its fourth 8-man high school football championship in five years.

(TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance.

Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40.

The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.Trending51-year-old man arrested following attempted abduction at Traverse City Meijer parking lotGRAND TRAVERSE COUNTY, Mich,.

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.Meanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.TrendingParents arrested

The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.\nMany homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.\n\nHomes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.\n\n“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”\n\nAllowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.\nBut it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.\n“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.\nPortable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.\nPulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.\nThe 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.\n\nThe administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.\nA shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.\nHousing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.\nTariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.\nTariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.\n\nTrending\n\nMississippi man charged with identity trafficking in Jefferson County\nA Mississippi man is facing serious charges in Jefferson County, including trafficking stolen identities and being a fugitive from justice.\n\nTwo UAB football players injured, one arrested after stabbing at operations center\nBIRMINGHAM, Ala.

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)Comment on this story0CommentShare storySharetopics: Mortgage ratesPortable mortgagesHousing affordabilityLock-in effectHomeownershipHousing supplyMortgage-backed securitiesTariffsWASHINGTON (TNND) — The Trump administration is considering another method to bring down soaring housing costs through mortgage rates that are pricing people out of homeownership and keeping homes from coming onto the market.Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating “portable mortgages,” which would allow homebuyers to take their mortgage rate with them when they decide to move. The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture.

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.Meanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.TrendingErika Kirk opens up about wishing for pregnancy after husband\'s tragic assassinationKirk joined Megyn Kelly for a live interview on the last stop of Kelly\'s Sirius XM tour in Glendale, Arizona.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)Comment on this story0CommentShare storySharetopics: Mortgage ratesPortable mortgagesHousing affordabilityLock-in effectHomeownershipHousing supplyMortgage-backed securitiesTariffsWASHINGTON (TNND) — The Trump administration is considering another method to bring down soaring housing costs through mortgage rates that are pricing people out of homeownership and keeping homes from coming onto the market.Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating “portable mortgages,” which would allow homebuyers to take their mortgage rate with them when they decide to move. The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.TrendingErika Kirk opens up about wishing for pregnancy after husband\'s tragic assassinationKirk joined Megyn Kelly for a live interview on the last stop of Kelly\'s Sirius XM tour in Glendale, Arizona.

(Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\nBy Alex SchwartzPUBLISHED: November 23, 2025 at 5:00 AM EST | UPDATED: November 23, 2025 at 7:30 AM ESTAs the longest-serving member of the city Rent Guidelines Board, and the only member appointed by Mayor Bill de Blasio, I voted for a rent freeze in 2020, during the early months of COVID. I also authored the RGB’s subsequent order to freeze the rent for an additional six months.\nI agree with Zohran Mamdani that New York’s affordable housing crisis demands immediate attention. However, I disagree with Mamdani’s pledge to freeze the rents of all rent-stabilized housing for four years. The arguments in support of a multi-year rent freeze are misguided and the consequences of such a freeze would endanger the physical and financial viability of thousands of rent-stabilized buildings, many of which were built or preserved with taxpayer dollars.\nThe Misleading Argument for a Rent Freeze\nMamdani and many other advocates for a rent freeze emphasize that the RGB under Mayor Adams authorized higher increases than under the previous de Blasio administration. They highlight the fact that while one-year leases under Adams increased by a cumulative 12.5% over four years, they increased by just 5.5% over the eight years of the de Blasio administration, during which time the RGB froze the rent three times (in 2016, 2017, and 2020).\nThese points are true, but they are also misleading. First, they overlook the fact that until 2019, when Albany passed the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act (HSTPA), landlords could raise the rent outside of the RGB’s annual adjustments.\nBefore that law, they could raise the rent by 18% to 20% with each vacancy, and they could increase rents by a percentage of the cost of building-wide major capital improvements (MCI) (e.g., new roofs, boilers), and of individual apartment improvements (IAI) (e.g., remodeled bathrooms and kitchens).\nIndeed, many landlords relied on vacancy, Major Capital Improvement, and Individual Apartment Improvement increases to trigger what was known as “luxury deregulation.” This means that when rents reached a certain threshold (in 2019 it was $2,775) landlords could remove the unit from rent stabilization and charge whatever the market would bear. More than 170,000 units were deregulated in this way between 1994 and 2020, with most of the deregulated units being in Manhattan.\nHSTPA changed all this. It eliminated deregulation (with very few exceptions), it prohibited vacancy increases, and it greatly reduced the maximum rent increase allowed for MCIs and IAIs. Starting in 2019, the only way for landlords to increase rents of rent-stabilized apartments, apart from much-reduced MCIs and IAIs, was to apply the maximum allowable increase authorized by the RGB.\nThat’s not all. Inflation was exceedingly low during the de Blasio years, averaging just 1.6%. This was not the case under Adams. From January 2022 through September 2025, the consumer price index for the New York region increased at an average annual rate of 4.2%. As a result, the RGB’s rent increases during the Adams administration, after adjusting for inflation, were lower than under de Blasio. In fact, they were often negative, effectively delivering rent rollbacks.\nThe RGB staff calculates a “composite” rent adjustment for each year, combining one- and two-year increases (about half of all rent stabilized tenants opt for 2-year leases), and through 2019, vacancy increases. This composite measure, adjusted for inflation, averaged -0.96% during the first three years of the Adams administration (the final rent adjustment just went into effect last month, and we don’t know what the inflation rate will be).\nBy comparison, during the eight years of de Blasio’s term, the composite rent adjustment decreased by an average of -.22% (before COVID and the concurrent spike in inflation, the average increased by 0.72%). In sum, the RGB in both the Adams and de Blasio administrations authorized very low, often negative, rent increases after adjusting for inflation.\nNew York City’s rent increases are also consistently lower than those of other cities and states with rent regulation. Los Angeles, for example, recently amended its rent regulations to allow annual increases to range from 1% to 4%. However, the law allows landlords to reset rents at market-levels after each vacancy. The state of Oregon, sets annual rent increases at 6% for buildings with more than 30 units, and by the lesser of 10% or 7% plus the Consumer Price Index in smaller buildings.\nThe Consequences of a Rent Freeze\nWithout adequate rental income, landlords struggle to cover the cost of maintaining and operating their buildings and to meet their mortgage payments. A rent freeze, especially the multi-year freeze that Mamdani proposes, would put tens of thousands of rent-stabilized buildings in physical and financial peril.\nA freeze on rents won’t stop the cost of insurance, repairs, utilities, and other essentials from increasing. Already, more than 9% of all rent stabilized buildings, 1,563 in total, are distressed, with operating costs exceeding income. And this does not include hundreds more whose income falls short of their combined operating costs and mortgage obligations. Even more buildings hover on the brink of insolvency.\nThe buildings most at risk were built before 1974 and have at least 80% of their units rent-stabilized. They are mostly located in low-income neighborhoods of the Bronx, upper Manhattan, and Brooklyn. Unlike their partially regulated counterparts in core Manhattan and the more affluent sections of Brooklyn, the owners of these buildings would not be able to offset the effects of a rent freeze by charging higher rents on their unregulated units.\nA rent freeze would also wreak havoc on thousands of buildings that were built or preserved with city subsidies. New York City invested more than $35 billion, adjusting for inflation, since the late 1980s on more than 640,000 housing units for mostly low- and moderate-income households. Approximately 290,000 rental units in New York City currently benefit from city subsidies. Most of this housing is subject to rent stabilization; indeed, it constitutes more than 25% of all rent-stabilized housing.\nMany of these properties are already in a precarious financial condition. In testimony to the RGB and in various reports, affordable housing groups have documented the worsening financial condition of city-subsidized housing. It is being squeezed by rapidly increasing expenses and declining revenue.\nSince COVID, expenses have consistently outpaced the 3% or 4% annual increases that the city typically requires to be budgeted for its subsidized housing. Average property insurance premiums, for example, increased by more than 40% over the past two years. Concurrently, rental incomes have failed to increase at the budgeted rate of 2% or 3%, and have often declined due to growing rental arrears and other factors.\nA recent study published by the Association for Housing and Neighborhood Development, a coalition of more than 80 nonprofit housing groups, found that of the 112,000 units of city-subsidized housing that they could match with Department of Finance records, more than half were in the red, with expenses exceeding income. A prolonged rent freeze would only worsen the crisis, and undermine New York City’s four decades of investment in affordable housing.\nThe Case for Rent Subsidies\nMamdani rightly recognizes the city’s housing affordability crisis. Nearly half of all renters spend more than 30% of their income on housing, and more than a quarter spend more than 50%. When people are rent-burdened they struggle to afford food, clothes, health care, transportation, and other necessities and are too often an emergency away from becoming homeless.\nBut a rent freeze would do little to improve affordability for rent-burdened tenants. Instead, the city could increase its already large rent subsidy program (CityFHEPS) to enable more low-income tenants to afford their rent-stabilized homes. The city could also expand existing rent freeze programs for seniors and people with disabilities to include other low-income renters. These programs currently freeze the rent for elderly and disabled rent-stabilized tenants with incomes of less than $50,000 who spend more than 30% of their income on housing.\nThe city reduces the property taxes for the owners of these apartments to offset uncollected rent increases. Better yet, the city could redesign these programs to ensure that participants spend no more than 30% of their income on rent. These solutions would be costly, but unlike a rent freeze they would actually address the city’s housing affordability crisis and help maintain the physical and financial health of its rent-stabilized housing.\nThere have been times when rent freezes were justified, but this is not one of them. Freezing the rent now, especially for multiple years in a row, would harm tenants and their homes.\nSchwartz is the longest-serving member on the NYC Rent Guidelines Board and a professor of public and urban policy at the New School.\nShare this:\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook\nClick to share on Bluesky (Opens in new window)\nBluesky\nClick to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX\nRevContent Feed\nMost PopularMost PopularSecond suspect ID’d in death of Celeste Rivas, teen found dead in D4vd’s car: reportSecond suspect ID'd in death of Celeste Rivas, teen found dead in D4vd's car: reportWoman, 95, killed in Queens fire, daughter and 6-year-old great-granddaughter critically hurtWoman, 95, killed in Queens fire, daughter and 6-year-old great-granddaughter critically hurtMan, 23, stabbed to death, beaten with baseball bat on street near Times SquareMan, 23, stabbed to death, beaten with baseball bat on street near Times SquareQueens couple beaten by mob for objecting to rowdy car meetup, vehicle set on fireQueens couple beaten by mob for objecting to rowdy car meetup, vehicle set on fireYoung man killed, shot multiple times in the head in the BronxYoung man killed, shot multiple times in the head in the BronxJohn Mara can finish the job of saving the Giants by cleaning houseJohn Mara can finish the job of saving the Giants by cleaning houseFatally stabbed dad of 4 was visiting Brooklyn NYCHA complex where he grew up: exFatally stabbed dad of 4 was visiting Brooklyn NYCHA complex where he grew up: exFDNY union demands answers on sudden city discovery of 68 boxes of 9/11 toxin docsFDNY union demands answers on sudden city discovery of 68 boxes of 9/11 toxin docsNYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch apologizes to synagogue congregation for protest responseNYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch apologizes to synagogue congregation for protest responseCops track fatal hit-run Tesla driver via lost plate as mom mourns ‘bright, beautiful’ daughterCops track fatal hit-run Tesla driver via lost plate as mom mourns 'bright, beautiful' daughter"", ""opinion\nMaine’s housing affordability crisis is not a zoning problem — it’s an economic one\nTue, 11/18/2025 - 10:31pm\nAudra Caler\n(Photo courtesy Metrocreative)\n(Photo courtesy Metrocreative)\nZoning reform has become the Legislature’s preferred answer to Maine’s housing crisis. It’s tidy, inexpensive, and offers the reassuring glow of “doing something.” But in the parts of the state where the shortage is most acute — coastal towns, service-center cities, and tourism-driven regions — zoning was never the real barrier. Treating it as the centerpiece of state housing policy has let lawmakers dodge the harder conversation: the economics of actually building housing in Maine. Communities figured this out long before Augusta. When Rockland passed a $10 million housing infrastructure bond, the goal wasn’t to squeeze more theoretical density onto a zoning map. Rockland was reacting to the real bottleneck: the cost of preparing land so housing can exist at all. Sewer extensions, water upgrades, stormwater systems, street improvements, and electrical work routinely push site costs well into six figures per unit in coastal towns. No zoning amendment fills that hole. Rockland stepped in because the State has not. The same dynamic plays out across Camden, Rockport, Bar Harbor, Falmouth, and Yarmouth. In these markets, even a modest home now costs north of $400,000 before anyone hangs a porch light. Construction bids keep climbing. Labor shortages slow everything down and raise financing costs. Infrastructure systems are aging or maxed out. Allowing a duplex, a fourplex, or a density bonus doesn’t change the reality that the underlying pro forma collapses under land prices, sitework, and interest rates. Zoning makes something legal — it does not make it feasible. Maine does have strong tools for deeply affordable rental housing, thanks to the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and MaineHousing’s gap financing programs. But for middle-income housing — the 80–140% AMI households who keep our communities running — there is no comparable support. No workforce housing fund. No soft-loan pool. No risk-mitigation tools for small developers. No statewide infrastructure program. Without these tools, zoning reform simply rearranges possibilities on paper. If the Legislature wants progress where it matters most, it needs to pivot from land-use theory to development economics. That means legislation that gives communities and builders the tools required to close the gap between feasibility and construction. A State Housing Infrastructure Fund should be the starting point. Local governments cannot absorb multi-million-dollar sewer and water upgrades one project at a time. A statewide program — grants or zero-interest loans tied directly to housing creation — would immediately unlock stalled sites in workforce-strained communities like Rockland, Camden, Bar Harbor, Bethel, Farmington, Rangeley, and Greenville. Maine also needs a Workforce Housing Finance Program aimed squarely at the missing middle. Soft second loans, forgivable loans, and construction-to-permanent financing for 80–140% AMI units would mirror MaineHousing’s successful affordable rental programs but serve the segment where demand is highest and financing gaps are widest. A Predevelopment and Risk-Mitigation Fund would give smaller developers a fair shot. The modest projects best suited to Maine’s villages and walkable neighborhoods often die before they start because engineering, environmental review, and early design come with real financial risk. A state backstop for part of these costs — paired with partial guarantees on construction loans — would help more builders take on small-scale, infill, and missing-middle projects. The Legislature should also create a State Workforce Housing Tax Credit, a targeted version of the federal LIHTC model but tailored to middle-income rental and ownership units. Even a modest credit would attract equity and help close financing gaps in high-cost towns. Finally, Maine should modernize Affordable Housing TIF so municipalities can use it to support workforce housing, not just deeply affordable units. Communities willing to put their own skin in the game — through bonds, infrastructure commitments, or land contributions — should be eligible for matching funds or enhanced TIF flexibility. Municipalities are already stepping up. Rockland has bonded for infrastructure. Communities across the state — Bangor, Brunswick, Yarmouth, South Portland, Scarborough, and others — have rewritten zoning, identified sites, and streamlined permitting. But they cannot fix the fundamental cost structure alone. Zoning sets the stage; economics determines whether anything ever gets built. If Maine wants more homes in the communities where workers are being priced out, the Legislature needs to move beyond symbolic zoning tweaks and adopt the financial tools that actually make housing possible.

It's not just another competition, it's a national call to action - an invitation to roll up our sleeves and tackle one of the greatest challenges of our time: making quality housing more attainable.\n\nReducing the Total Cost of Housing\n\nPeople are priced out of the dream of homeownership. Nearly 75% of households across the country are unable to afford the median-priced new home and more than 50% of Gen Z renters believe winning the lottery is their only ticket to buying their first home.\n\nConstruction costs keep rising. Productivity and innovation haven't kept pace. Traditional methods can't deliver the speed or affordability needed to solve this growing problem. This Challenge aims to change that; bringing together the best minds in design, engineering, construction, technology, and business to rethink the entire process of how homes are designed, built and utilized for long-term value. Building on the 20-year legacy of the U.S. Department of Energy's Solar Decathlon, the Challenge expands the conversation from energy performance to total cost of housing - focusing beyond what price the home can be delivered to include its cost of maintenance, utilities, insurance and the other hidden, growing costs of homes.\n\nCharlotte Mayor Vi Lyles praised the initiative,'We are proud to host the Housing Innovation Challenge. Affordable housing is a critical area of investment that remains a priority for the City of Charlotte. This competition has a meaningful purpose which is to create more affordable housing not just in our city, but in every city across the country. The Challenge shines a spotlight on the incredible talent we have right here in Charlotte and across the Carolinas - architects, engineers, builders, and entrepreneurs who can lead the nation in housing innovation.\n\nThe Competition\n\nThe Challenge is a two-phase design and build competition open to universities, colleges, and vocational schools across North America. Through the Housing Innovation Alliance's national network, the teams will partner with industry veterans to operationalize their ideas and introduce the next generation of housing solutions.\n\nPhase 1: Design + Planning (December 2025 - May 2026)\n\nPhase 1 pushes teams to rethink housing industry norms - advancing conceptual and schematic designs that explore new approaches to design, materials, systems, construction, and long-term performance. 'This first phase is about bold ideas,' says Bobby Vance, Competition Co-Director and Assistant Professor at Virginia Tech. 'We want proposals that challenge entrenched norms, demonstrate innovation in industrialized or hybrid off-site construction, and show how homes can be built faster, more affordably, and with lower future operating costs.'\n\nWorking within (while also challenging) existing Charlotte zoning parameters and affordability targets for households earning ≤ 80% AMI, teams may submit up to three design proposals, each envisioning a home that is beautiful, attainable, and replicable. Land is provided, allowing each proposal to focus on optimizing construction cost and long term operational performance.\n\nAll submissions are due March 20, 2026, and will be evaluated through the H.O.M.E. Framework - a proprietary framework for a holistic view of affordability contemplating the costs of Home Delivery, Occupancy, Maintenance, and the benefits of increased Equity - by a committee of national experts, industry leaders, and City of Charlotte partners.\n\nUp to ten Finalist teams will be selected to move on to Phase 2.

'As a Charlottean and one of the original investors in housing-related innovation, I am incredibly proud to bring this Challenge to the city and, further, to the benefit of the country as a whole.

It's not just another competition, it's a national call to action - an invitation to roll up our sleeves and tackle one of the greatest challenges of our time: making quality housing more attainable.\n\nReducing the Total Cost of Housing\n\nPeople are priced out of the dream of homeownership. Nearly 75% of households across the country are unable to afford the median-priced new home and more than 50% of Gen Z renters believe winning the lottery is their only ticket to buying their first home.\n\nConstruction costs keep rising. Productivity and innovation haven't kept pace. Traditional methods can't deliver the speed or affordability needed to solve this growing problem. This Challenge aims to change that; bringing together the best minds in design, engineering, construction, technology, and business to rethink the entire process of how homes are designed, built and utilized for long-term value. Building on the 20-year legacy of the U.S. Department of Energy's Solar Decathlon, the Challenge expands the conversation from energy performance to total cost of housing - focusing beyond what price the home can be delivered to include its cost of maintenance, utilities, insurance and the other hidden, growing costs of homes.\n\nCharlotte Mayor Vi Lyles praised the initiative,'We are proud to host the Housing Innovation Challenge. Affordable housing is a critical area of investment that remains a priority for the City of Charlotte. This competition has a meaningful purpose which is to create more affordable housing not just in our city, but in every city across the country. The Challenge shines a spotlight on the incredible talent we have right here in Charlotte and across the Carolinas - architects, engineers, builders, and entrepreneurs who can lead the nation in housing innovation.\n\nThe Competition\n\nThe Challenge is a two-phase design and build competition open to universities, colleges, and vocational schools across North America. Through the Housing Innovation Alliance's national network, the teams will partner with industry veterans to operationalize their ideas and introduce the next generation of housing solutions.\n\nPhase 1: Design + Planning (December 2025 - May 2026)\n\nPhase 1 pushes teams to rethink housing industry norms - advancing conceptual and schematic designs that explore new approaches to design, materials, systems, construction, and long-term performance. 'This first phase is about bold ideas,' says Bobby Vance, Competition Co-Director and Assistant Professor at Virginia Tech. 'We want proposals that challenge entrenched norms, demonstrate innovation in industrialized or hybrid off-site construction, and show how homes can be built faster, more affordably, and with lower future operating costs.'\n\nWorking within (while also challenging) existing Charlotte zoning parameters and affordability targets for households earning ≤ 80% AMI, teams may submit up to three design proposals, each envisioning a home that is beautiful, attainable, and replicable. Land is provided, allowing each proposal to focus on optimizing construction cost and long term operational performance.\n\nAll submissions are due March 20, 2026, and will be evaluated through the H.O.M.E. Framework - a proprietary framework for a holistic view of affordability contemplating the costs of Home Delivery, Occupancy, Maintenance, and the benefits of increased Equity - by a committee of national experts, industry leaders, and City of Charlotte partners.\n\nUp to ten Finalist teams will be selected to move on to Phase 2. Each Finalist will receive $10,000 in travel support and be invited to the Housing Innovation Summit in Charlotte (May 19-21, 2026), where they will be officially announced to the public.\n\nPhase 2: Build + Showcase (May 2026 - October 2027)\n\nIn Phase 2, the finalist teams transition from concept to construction, working hand-in-hand with leading national builders and industry partners to transform their schematic ideas into full-scale homes built in Charlotte.

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40.

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.\n\nIt’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)\nIt’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.\nHow Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater Mortgages\n\nBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.\nBut according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.\n\nHere’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:\n\n27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.\n18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.\n10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.\nThe playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.\nWhen prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.\nWhat Happens When You’re Underwater?\nFor homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.\n\nYou can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.\nYou can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.\nThe risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.\nIt becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.\nIn short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.\nIs a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?\nInto this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.\nSupporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”\nThe Upside: Lower Payments\n\nLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)\nA 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.\nA New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.\nLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.\nThe Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger Risks\nThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: \n\n30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,000\n50-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000\nYou’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.\nThe National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)Comment on this story0CommentShare storySharetopics: Mortgage ratesPortable mortgagesHousing affordabilityLock-in effectHomeownershipHousing supplyMortgage-backed securitiesTariffsWASHINGTON (TNND) — The Trump administration is considering another method to bring down soaring housing costs through mortgage rates that are pricing people out of homeownership and keeping homes from coming onto the market.Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating “portable mortgages,” which would allow homebuyers to take their mortgage rate with them when they decide to move. The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.TrendingSuspect in custody, accused of shooting Pike County man to deathPike County authorities responded to a shooting Sunday morning along Curtis Lane, where deputies say 37-year-old Jason Scott was shot in the head and died at thDeadly shooting on Columbus eastside marks 4th homicide for the city in a week\nAn east Columbus apartment house on North Hampton Road was surrounded by crime tape Friday night after a deadly shooting.One dead, one hospitalized after crash on Stelzer RoadOne person has died and another was rushed to the hospital following an overnight crash at the intersection of Stelzer and Codet roads.\'Lights of hope\': Crawford County community mourns couple allegedly killed by sonThe Crawford County community gathered for a candlelit vigil to honor Lindsey and Lisa Anatra, a husband and wife found dead in their Crestline home last WednesFirefighters battle large commercial blaze in south ColumbusFirefighters responded to a commercial fire early Sunday morning along Harmon Avenue in south Columbus.NEWS IN PHOTOS:""Local""6Caleb Downs hands out free turkeys and hams at the Mid-Ohio Market ahead of Thanksgiving3Michigan aims for historic 5th win against Ohio State9Columbus Zoo announces final four names for new baby elephant4Deadly shooting on Columbus eastside marks 4th homicide for the city in a week\nACCESSIBILITYDownload Our Mobile Apps:Terms & ConditionsCopyright NoticesEEO Public File ReportFCC InfoFCC ApplicationsPublic File AssistanceContactNews TeamContestsNewsWeatherSportsGDCGDC MarketplaceGame CenterPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyDo Not Sell or ShareCookie Preferencestwitter iconfacebook icon 2025 Sinclair, Inc.', 'The Lofton, affordable apartments, open on south side NewsNewsCaleb Downs hands out free turkeys and hams at the Mid-Ohio Market ahead of ThanksgivingOhio State All-American safety Caleb Downs is preparing to play in his second rivalry game against Michigan.Michigan aims for historic 5th win against Ohio StateThe Wolverines\' current four-game winning streak is not only impressive but also historic.Columbus Zoo announces final four names for new baby elephantThe Columbus Zoo is asking the community to help choose the name of its newest baby elephant.

The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates.

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.Comment with BubblesBE THE FIRST TO COMMENTMeanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.TrendingMan found dead in wheelchair on side of road in Tysons A man was found dead in a wheelchair on the side of the road in Tysons, Va.Man found naked, unconscious after Fairfax County fight later dies: PoliceFairfax County police are investigating a deadly incident after officers responded to a fight early Monday morning.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)Comment on this story0CommentShare storySharetopics: Mortgage ratesPortable mortgagesHousing affordabilityLock-in effectHomeownershipHousing supplyMortgage-backed securitiesTariffsWASHINGTON (TNND) — The Trump administration is considering another method to bring down soaring housing costs through mortgage rates that are pricing people out of homeownership and keeping homes from coming onto the market.Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating “portable mortgages,” which would allow homebuyers to take their mortgage rate with them when they decide to move. The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.TrendingMan found dead in wheelchair on side of road in Tysons A man was found dead in a wheelchair on the side of the road in Tysons, Va.Driver killed in single-vehicle crash in Montgomery CountyA driver is dead following a Sunday night single-vehicle collision in Montgomery County, according to police.

Councilmember Brooke Pinto introduced a sweeping package of 23 bills Monday morning aimed at expanding economic opportunities, improving youth development programs and supporting local businesses in the District.According to Pinto, the “Prosper DC Plan” builds on Pinto’s earlier public safety-focused initiatives — Peace DC and Secure DC — by addressing what she calls the economic and opportunity gaps that contribute to instability for many residents. The plan includes measures to improve job access, reduce barriers for entrepreneurs, expand youth programming and make housing more affordable.SEE ALSO | DC invests $9.2M in program monitoring students traveling to & from school""We must create pathways to economic prosperity for all District residents and entrepreneurs to ensure the District remains a place where people want to live, work, grow their business, and create communities that are vibrant.” said Councilmember Pinto. “As I have met with residents across the District, it is clear folks are eager to be part of lifting up the city -- creating pathways to contribute, earn, and grow must be central to the future we are fighting for together. My Prosper DC Plan will help uplift families, residents, and businesses by investing in economic opportunities for residents, competitiveness for businesses, positive youth development, and affordable, healthy, and accessible communities.” In weeks’ worth of council hearings and testimony, saying more resources are needed to prevent kids from getting into trouble and crime, Pinto said this is her answer.WJLASeven of the 23 bills in the package focus on juveniles and their development in the district. We asked Pinto why she thinks these bills are realistic and how they relate to reducing juvenile crime.“We have to do more to prevent and if somebody violates the law they have to be held accountable,” Pinto said “I\'ve always believed that we can and must do both in our city, which is why every time we advance a specific tool or specific idea it is one in a holistic set of pathways that we have to move forward in.”The bills focused on juveniles do the following:Allows minors to open a deposit account without parental consentRequires D.C. schools to create appropriate AI use for students and staffCovers 50% of wages for employers who hire a young adult parent7News asked Pinto why employers get subsidies.“I\'m a big believer in aligning incentives,” Pinto said. “We have a population in D.C. that is seeing increased rates of teen pregnancy and young people having children, and that often creates a lot of economic challenges for that family. And so, what we wanted to create with this bill was a pilot program to provide some subsidization to get access to employment.The bills also:Gives $300,000 to non-profits for social and educational programmingRequires the Deputy Mayor for Education to create an app that connects teens looking for jobs with hiring in all eight wards. Expands the Marion Barry youth program from 24 to 30 years old.The Department of Parks and Recreation would also be required to open and operate a teen center in each quadrant of the city.Pinto said she wants this to pass and be included in this year\'s budget. 7News asked if the D.C. budget could handle the enhancement after the budget crisis. Pinto said it\'s all about focusing the budget in the right place.""Bringing in these other aspects, this holistic approach to addressing juvenile crime, I think it makes a lot of sense as long as it’s not at the expense of public safety,"" Joshua Ederheimer, a former official with the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and current assistant professor at the University of Virginia, said. Ederheimer backs the program, howeverMy only concern when I saw this was: Is money going to be diverted from the police department to support these very good programs? I think that’s a very bad idea because the department is understaffed and they need the funding.The D.C. Police Union has said the department is short about 800 officers, out of a current 3,200, while the mayor says they need about 500. Enforcement, Ederheimer adds, is crucial to keeping a city safe, but it\'s far from the only answer. ""I think any funding for these well-thought-out programs needs to complement and be in addition to the police department budget,"" he said.

The task force was created to oversee security, logistics, and federal government support for the 2025 Club World Cup and the 2026 FIFA World Cup, jointly hosted by the United States.

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.Meanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.TrendingStrong winds, storms to impact Middle Tennessee, Southern Kentucky holiday travelFOX 17 News is in a Code Red Weather Alert for possible strong to severe thunderstorms Monday night into Tuesday morning.$50K stolen from high-end retailers in Nashville over four months, arrest made An organized retail crime suspect is facing 28 charges after being accused of stealing more than $50,000 worth of merchandise from numerous Nashville businessesSelf-defense claim in deadly Madison shooting being investigated A man called 911 to admit to a shooting in Madison in self-defense.Metro Nashville Police officers responded to an apartment at the Gibson Creek on East WebsterNew $80M resort opens in Pigeon Forge, a big draw for Tennessee vacationersA major new resort has opened its doors in Pigeon Forge after an $80 million investment, adding fresh appeal to one of East Tennessee’s most popular vacation deHas Democratic Congressional Nominee Aftyn Behn done herself irreparable harm?

Phase two went into effect in August 2023 and placed limits on security deposit maximums, requiring landlords to consider applications on a first-come first-served basis. \nAccording to the city’s original roadmap for the process, city officials during phase three will consider addressing issues like monthly gross income screenings, no-cause evictions and application requirements. \n“Stability and affordability comes from community ownership, and our mission is to create those democratic communities that are permanently affordable and environmentally sustainable,” Chazandra Kern, a project manager for SquareOne Villages, said. “With TOPA, we see it as one of those tools that opens up the prospects for renters to not only maintain that stability, but to become co-owners in the housing communities.” \nIn Eugene, housing affordability and stability has been one of the top issues on residents’ minds, according to Celine Swenson-Harris, chair of the Democratic Party of Lane County. \n“When I am out knocking on doors, when I talk to volunteers who go out knocking on doors and come back and talk to me about the conversations they had, we see housing and affordability show up again and again. No matter where you are in this community, and across so many different age and income demographics, housing and homelessness is one of the topics that we hear pretty much every time,” Swenson-Harris said. \nThe National Low Income Housing Coalition found that in Oregon, affordable rent for minimum wage-workers caps at $783 a month, but an average one-bedroom’s fair market rent is $1,435 a month. According to Eugene housing stats from January, 51% of the city’s population are renters, and 61% of them experience cost-burdens. \nAdvocates are hoping that the city council will consider TOPA for phase three of the renters protection process. \n\n   View Story Comments  \n\n 4    Like This Story   \n \n    Share on Facebook   \n \n    Share on X   \n \n    Email this Story   \n \n    Print this Story   \n\n Leave a Comment   \n\nMore to Discover \n\n More in community  \n\n Just my cup of tea    \n\n Matcha lattes and building community    \n\n Take a step forward this Walktober    \n\n Approximately 4,000 attend Eugene “No Kings 2” protest    \n\n Flock cameras to be paused within the next 24 hours    \n\n Composting in Eugene      \n\n More in community-news  \n\n Eugene Planning Commission backs code changes allowing taller new UO dorms in East Campus    \n\n Health Enrichment for Low-Income Pets provides pet services to the Eugene community    \n\n Volunteer groups hope to bridge gaps between UO and Eugene community    \n\n Residents talk Flock, housing affordability at city council meeting    \n\n ACLU lawsuit against Eugene renews debate over police surveillance    \n\n House fire across from UO residence hall      \n\n More in News  \n\n UO wellness center to take up previous Shake Smart location in Student Recreation Center    \n\n Career Closet Pop-Up provides free professional attire for students    \n\n UO professor arrested on child sex-abuse charges    \n\n UO legal counsel explains ICE protocols and legal boundaries during faculty senate meeting    \n\n Former SOJC Dean Juan-Carlos Molleda cleared of wrongdoing by state ethics commission    \n\n UO students leverage AI to create college marketplace and housing-finder website        \n \nAbout the Contributors \n\n Billie Corsetti, News Reporter  \n Billie is a news reporter at the Daily Emerald and a sophomore studying Journalism and Political Science.

(Alyssa Garcia/Emerald)\nThe Eugene City Council held a meeting on Monday, facilitating discussion surrounding Automated License Plate Readers, Amazon distribution facility rumors and housing affordability programs.\nAll councilors were present during the meeting, with Councilor Leech calling in from Zoom.\nDuring the Committee Reports and Items of Interest, Mayor Knudson spoke about community concerns surrounding the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the city.\n“Last week, I joined elected leaders serving at the federal, state and local levels — indeed many of our city council members — in opposing the violent detention of our neighbors and the denial of due process to members of our community by (ICE),” Knudson said. “This situation is not news to us, but it is nonetheless alarming and unacceptable to learn of reported actions carried out by ICE and Lane County.”\nCity Manager Sarah Medary was also present, and spoke briefly before public comment regarding the status of growth research from the Envision Eugene Technical Advisory Committee. Medary said she believes EETAC will have a final report on the city’s economic growth and recommendations by January.\nForty-nine speakers signed up for public comment, many of which used their time to urge the council to permanently take down the ALPRs. Some speakers asked Medary to move quickly in setting up another work session before her retirement in December.\n“A pause is not a stop, and the cameras remain up on the poles. That’s unfortunate, because they are pretty offensive to see, and pretty embarrassing to our visitors as well,” Sam Edwards, one public commentator, said. “I’m here tonight to urge the city manager to move with haste before retiring and get that contract where it belongs — the paper shredder.”\nAnother group of commentators wore homemade pins which said “Say No To Amazon” and spoke extensively on the new package-and-delivery center being built by the Eugene airport, which has been rumored to be an Amazon distribution center..\n“Employment that Amazon offers is labor intensive, so intensive that to meet their goals, Amazon will be replacing local workers, in just a few years in 2030, with robots that work faster and don’t need bathroom breaks, or healthcare,” Charmaine Landing, a member of Say No To Amazon, said. “Without dependable long term jobs, workers can’t plan for a future, which might include owning a home, supporting elders or sending kids to college. I honestly believe Amazon will not be a good partner for Eugene.”\nDanny Patch, another public commentator, was worried about the effect of increased vehicles from the warehouse on traffic.\nMultiple other public commentators urged the council to collaborate with local housing developers to tap into funds for affordable housing granted by the state legislature through the Moderate Income Revolving Loan.\nMIRL is a program that was established during the 2024 legislative session from Senate Bill 1537. The program enables the Oregon Housing and Community Services to offer no-interest loans to cities and jurisdictions that meet specific requirements to build low to moderate income housing.\n“(OCHS has) $50 million for (MIRL), but in that case, the council needs to adopt a resolution to enable the program here locally,” Emily Reiman, CEO of Dev Northwest, a non-profit community development organization, said. “The city needs to adopt an application process for developers to apply for those funds.”\nWhen public comment concluded, Councilors Clark and Groves expressed their interest in learning more about MIRL, asking for a later discussion with Medary.\nThe next city council meeting is scheduled for Nov. 24.\n1\nView Story Comments\n2\nLike This Story\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X\nEmail this Story\nPrint this Story\nView Comments (1)\nMore to Discover\nMore in City News\nHealth Enrichment for Low-Income Pets provides pet services to the Eugene community\nApproximately 4,000 attend Eugene “No Kings 2” protest\nFlock cameras to be paused within the next 24 hours\nComposting in Eugene\nTariffs and slower growth squeeze Lane County businesses\nEugene City Council unanimously recommends the pause of Flock cameras\nMore in community-news\nHousing-affordability advocates urge city official to enact opportunity to purchase act\nEugene Planning Commission backs code changes allowing taller new UO dorms in East Campus\nVolunteer groups hope to bridge gaps between UO and Eugene community\nACLU lawsuit against Eugene renews debate over police surveillance\nHouse fire across from UO residence hall\nSeven arrested in burglary ring after shelter-in-place notice\nMore in Features\nPhotos: The No. 5 University of Oregon Ducks take on West Coast rivals the No. 19 USC Trojans winning 42-27\nUO history professor arraigned on 10 charges of encouraging child sex-abuse in the first degree\nNo. 7 Oregon football downs No. 15 USC 42-27 in top-15 shootout\nLive updates: No. 7 Oregon beats No. 15 USC, 42-27, in final regular-season home game\nUO professor arrested on child sex-abuse charges\nUO legal counsel explains ICE protocols and legal boundaries during faculty senate meeting\nAbout the Contributor\nBillie Corsetti, News Reporter\nBillie is a news reporter at the Daily Emerald and a sophomore studying Journalism and Political Science.

(Charles Krupa/The Associated Press)\n\nU.S. metro areas seeing more transit-oriented housing projects\n\nThe Associated Press//November 24, 2025//  \n\nListen to this article\nAT A GLANCE:\nTransit-oriented housing offers affordable units near bus, rail and subway lines\nCities like Los Angeles, Boston and Washington, D.C. are gaining developments\nStates adopt zoning reforms to allow more dense housing near transit\nChallenges include local opposition, funding gaps and rising construction costs\n\nBOSTON — After years of living on the street and crashing on friends’ couches, Quantavia Smith was given the keys to a Los Angeles studio apartment that came with an important perk — easy access to public transit.\n\nThe 38-year-old feels like she went from a life where “no one cares” to one where she has a safe place. And the metro station the apartment complex was literally built upon is a lifeline as she searches for work without a car.\n\n“It is more a sense of relief, a sense of independence,” said Smith, who moved into the unit in July. She receives some government assistance and pays 30 percent of her income for rent — just $19 a month for an efficiency apartment with a full-market value of $2,000.\n\n“Having your own space, you feel like you can do anything,” she said.\n\nMetro areas from Los Angeles to Boston have taken the lead in\xa0tying new housing\xa0developments to public transit, often teaming up with developers to streamline the permitting process and passing policies that promote developments that include a greater number of units.\n\nBuilding housing near public transit helps energize neglected neighborhoods and provide affordability, city officials say, while ensuring a steady stream of riders for transit systems and cutting\xa0greenhouse gas emissions\xa0by reducing the number of cars on the road.\n\n“Transit-oriented development should be one of, if not the biggest solution that we’re looking at for housing,” said Urban Institute Land Use Lab research director Yonah Freemark, who has written extensively on the topic. “It takes advantage of all of this money we’ve spent on transportation infrastructure. If you build the projects and don’t build anything around the areas near them, then it’s kind of like money thrown down the drain.”\n\nThe Santa Monica and Vermont Apartments, where Smith lives, is part of an ambitious plan by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to build 10,000 housing units near transit sites by 2031 — offering developers land discounts in exchange for affordable housing development and other community benefits.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., the transit authority since 2022 has completed eight projects that provided nearly 1,500 apartments and a million square feet of office space. About half were in partnership with Amazon, which committed $3.6 billion in low-cost loans and grants for affordable housing projects in Washington, as well as Nashville, Tennessee, and the Puget Sound area in Washington state. Almost all are within a half-mile of public transit.\n\n“Big cities face the greatest challenges when it comes to traffic congestion and high housing costs,” Freemark said. “Building new homes near transit helps address both problems by encouraging people to take transit while increasing housing supply.”\n\nIn Boston, the Pok Oi Residents in Chinatown is a 10-minute walk to the subway and a half-dozen bus stops. That’s a draw for Bernie Hernandez, who moved his family there from a Connecticut suburb after his daughter was accepted into a Boston university.\n\n“The big difference is commuting; you don’t need a car,” said Hernandez, who said he can walk to the grocery story and pharmacy. His 17-year-old daughter takes the subway to school. Now, his car mostly sits idle, saving him money on gas and time spent in traffic.\n\n“You get to go to different places very quickly,” Hernandez said. “Everything is convenient.”\n\nStates across the country are passing laws targeting restrictive zoning regulations that for decades prohibited multifamily construction and contributed to\xa0housing shortages.\n\nLast month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a state law allowing taller apartment buildings on land owned by transit agencies and near bus, train and subway lines.\n\n“Building more homes in our most sustainable locations is the key to tackling the affordability crisis and locking in California’s success for many years to come,” said state Sen. Scott Wiener, who authored the bill.\n\nCalifornia joins Colorado, which requires cities to allow an average of 40 housing units per acre within a quarter-mile of transit, and Utah, which mandates about 50 units per acre. In Washington, the governor this year signed a bill allowing taller housing developments in mixed-use commercial zones near transit.\n\n“We want to ensure that there are mixed-income, walkable, vibrant homes all around those transit investments and that people have the option of using cars less to improve the environmental health of our communities,” said Rep. Julia Reed, who authored the Washington bill. “It’s about giving people the opportunity to drive less and live more.”\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Maura Healey\xa0has made housing a priority. Among her most potent tools is a 2021 law that requires 177 towns or communities nearby to create zoning districts allowing multifamily development. The state provided nearly $8 million to more than 150 communities to help create these zones and threatened to cut funding for those that don’t. More than 6,000 housing units are in development as a result.\n\n“You put housing nearby public transit (and) it’s great for people,” Healey said. “They can literally get up, leave their home, walk to a commuter rail and get to work.”\n\nAmong the first to comply was Lexington, which has approved 10 projects, including a $115 million complex with 187 housing units and retail space.\n\nWalking past earth-moving equipment and dump trucks at the construction site earlier this year, project manager Quinlan Locke said: “This is a landscape yard. It’s commercial. It’s meant for trucking. Two years from now, it’s going to be meant for people who live here, work here and play here. This is going to become someone’s home.”\n\nSome advocates argue the lofty goals of transit-oriented housing are falling short due to fierce local resistance and lack of funding and support at the federal and state levels.\n\nHigher mortgage interest rates, more government red tape, rising construction costs and lack of investment at transit stations also have contributed to a troubling trend — nine times more housing units built far from public transit versus near it in the past two decades, according to a 2023 Urban Institute study.\n\nIn Massachusetts, 19 communities still haven’t created new zones. Some unsuccessfully sued the state to halt the law, while residents rejected new zones in others. Lexington eventually shrank its zone from 227 acres to 90 acres after residents complained.\n\n“If we allow the state to come in and dictate how we zone, what else are they going to come in and dictate?” said Anthony Renzoni, a selectman from the town of Holden, which sued the state and is drawing up a new zoning map after residents rejected the first one.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the six-story complex where Smith lives in East Hollywood is home to 300 new residents since opening in February. The area has gained a Filipino grocery and a medical clinic. A farmers market is set to open early next year.\n\nHalf of the building’s 187 units are reserved for formerly homeless residents like Smith, who had been living in a rundown motel via a voucher and before that on the street. She’s been assigned a case worker and is getting help with basic life skills, budgeting and finding work.\n\nEqually important: Smith, who can’t afford a car, doesn’t need one.\n\n“I’m very, very fortunate to be somewhere where the transit takes me where I want to go,” she said. “Where I want to go is not that far.”\n\nTags: Affordable housing,Boston housing,California housing law,Homelessness solutions,Los Angeles housing,Mixed-use development,Public transit,Transit-oriented development,Urban planning,Zoning reform\n\nRelated Articles\nYears after deadly fire, London tower to be taken down\nWorld’s oldest operating drive-in theater revived\nWith Kabul finally at peace, luxurious homes gain appeal\nWest Linn multifamily property fetches $33.6 million\nWaterfront Park bowl redevelopment in Portland land use review intakes | Nov. 17, 2025\nRelated Content\nWindsor Engineers expands into Portland\n\nWindsor Engineers has opened its newest office in Portland.\n\nNovember 24, 2025\n\n$40.8 million multifamily project in Portland building permits | Nov. 24, 2025\n\nA new construction permit is under inspection for construction of the Jamii Court Apartments on Southwest Barb[...]\n\nNovember 24, 2025\n\nIn-N-Out restaurant project in Portland land use review intakes | Nov. 24, 2025\n\nA type 2 procedure (adjustment) is pending for development of a burger restaurant with drive-thru service on N[...]\n\nNovember 24, 2025\n\nData center projects fuel scrutiny of power forecasts\n\nUtilities predict soaring electricity demand from data centers, raising concerns about speculative forecasts, [...]\n\nNovember 21, 2025\n\nPacific Northwest projects totaling $65.1 million in top bidders | Nov. 21, 2025\n\nThe Oregon Department of Transportation is preparing to award a $4.9 million contract for construction of curb[...]\n\nNovember 21, 2025\n\nPortland bans use of rental pricing algorithms\n\nThe Portland City Council on Wednesday passed a measure that bans corporate landlords from using rent-fixing p[...]\n\nNovember 20, 2025\n\nDJC Oregon Daily Newsletter\n\nEmail: *\nIndustry\nselect your industry\nSIGN UP\nBy signing up you agree to our\nPrivacy Policy\n\nNews\nWindsor Engineers expands into Portland\n$40.8 million multifamily project in Portland building permits | Nov. 24, 2025\nIn-N-Out restaurant project in Portland land use review intakes | Nov. 24, 2025\nU.S. metro areas seeing more transit-oriented housing projects\nData center projects fuel scrutiny of power forecasts\nPacific Northwest projects totaling $65.1 million in top bidders | Nov. 21, 2025\nPortland bans use of rental pricing algorithms\nHood River–White Salmon bridge project wins federal OK\nHistoric district status sought for Indianapolis’ Martindale area\nAffordable housing plan on track in historic Portland district\n$1.6 million multifamily project in Portland building permits | Nov. 17, 2025\nWaterfront Park bowl redevelopment in Portland land use review intakes | Nov. 17, 2025\nSee All News\nDJC People\nPrevious\nBrooke Everard | 2FORM Architecture\n\n2FORM Architecture has hired Brooke Everard as an associate architect.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)Comment on this story0CommentShare storySharetopics: Mortgage ratesPortable mortgagesHousing affordabilityLock-in effectHomeownershipHousing supplyMortgage-backed securitiesTariffsWASHINGTON (TNND) — The Trump administration is considering another method to bring down soaring housing costs through mortgage rates that are pricing people out of homeownership and keeping homes from coming onto the market.Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating “portable mortgages,” which would allow homebuyers to take their mortgage rate with them when they decide to move. The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.TrendingElection recount confirms Wintersville Council results, maintains election integrityThe final steps in the Ohio general election concluded on Monday morning in Jefferson County with a recount and audit of the election results from the general eBrooke High cheerleaders win 15th state championship titleThe Brooke High School cheerleading squad has secured its fifteenth state championship title by winning the 2025 Class AAA State Championship in Charleston, WesSteubenville Nutcracker Village returns with 230 displays for holiday seasonThe Steubenville Nutcracker Village has officially returned for the holiday season, showcasing 230 life-size nutcrackers throughout downtown Steubenville.

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost.

(TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest.

Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.Meanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.TrendingIdaho Group Pushes Bill to Name State Highway After Charlie KirkA proposal is in the works in the Idaho Legislature to rename State Highway 16 the &ldquo;Charlie Kirk Memorial Highway.&rdquo; The push comes from the Idaho Family Policy National gas prices steady at $3.03The national average price of gasoline is unchanged in the last week, averaging $3.03/g today.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)Comment on this story0CommentShare storySharetopics: Mortgage ratesPortable mortgagesHousing affordabilityLock-in effectHomeownershipHousing supplyMortgage-backed securitiesTariffsWASHINGTON (TNND) — The Trump administration is considering another method to bring down soaring housing costs through mortgage rates that are pricing people out of homeownership and keeping homes from coming onto the market.Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating “portable mortgages,” which would allow homebuyers to take their mortgage rate with them when they decide to move. The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.TrendingIdaho Group Pushes Bill to Name State Highway After Charlie KirkA proposal is in the works in the Idaho Legislature to rename State Highway 16 the &ldquo;Charlie Kirk Memorial Highway.&rdquo; The push comes from the Idaho Family Policy National gas prices steady at $3.03The national average price of gasoline is unchanged in the last week, averaging $3.03/g today.

That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.Comment with BubblesBE THE FIRST TO COMMENTMeanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.TrendingPenn State study finds cancer cluster in 15 PA countiesA new study out of Penn State is drawing attention to a 15&ndash;county stretch of Central Pennsylvania, where melanoma rates in adults over 50 are significantly highOvernight fire destroys multiple homes in Mount CarmelFirefighters spent the early morning hours battling a devastating multi-alarm blaze that tore through a row of homes on South Poplar Street, destroying several \'Anybody can dance\' Famed choreographer and dancer visits old studioFred Tallaksen has lived every dancer’s dream.

Metro was Canada’s second least-affordable area for renters in 2023 (again, the latest year of comparable data), with the median rental unit costing $1,715 per month — or 31.8 per cent of the median after-tax family income — up from $1,035 (26.3 per cent) a decade earlier in 2014.Article contentArticle contentAnd there’s more bad news. While the recent decline in house prices hasn’t been enough to meaningfully improve affordability, it has made it harder for builders to cover their costs, prompting a steep contraction in homebuilding at a time when the city needs more new homes.Article contentRead More\nMost Vancouverites believe the city’s 'brand' is in decline.

Borrowers must qualify at that highest threshold to ensure they can afford to pay their mortgage if interest rates rise.Article contentArticle contentAs well, Ratehub.ca calculated income requirements and mortgage payments based on a 10 per cent down payment.Article contentGraham notes that the drop in price and rates “did not really move the affordability dial” for those most affected by affordability challenges, first-time buyers.Article contentYet the study does point to a shift in Calgary’s resale real estate market, she adds.Article content“Calgary had been a seller’s market for quite some time, which started to unwind over the past couple of months,” she says. “That sales-to-new-listings ratio actually dropped” nearly nine percentage points in September. Calgary Real Estate Board statistics from Sept. 30 show the metric was 45 per cent, indicating a market with a balance between supply and demand. Yet the market has been trending toward favouring buyers as the ratio moves closer to 40 per cent, the threshold between a balanced and a buyer’s market, Graham says.Advertisement 1This advertisement has not loaded yet.Trending Braid: UCP performing major surgery on Alberta health care\nColumnists\nCalgary lands 14 spots on 2025 Canada Top 100 Restaurants list\nLocal News\nAdvertisement 1Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.Meanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.TrendingWoman taken into custody after police chase throughout multiples counties reached 110 mphA 41-year-old woman was taken into custody after a long high-speed pursuit.Crews battle blaze at Frankenmuth office buildingMultiple fire departments were called into assist the Frankenmuth Fire Department battle a blaze at a commercial office building on Sunday night.MMA fighter, 31, dies after suffering critical injury in final round of matchA mixed martial arts fighter died at the age of 31 after sustaining a critical injury during the final round of a match.Dispensary that recently became a 24-hour business hands out 100 free turkeysGENESEE COUNTY, Mich. &ndash; A local business that recently made the decision to become a 24/7 operation spent time on Monday giving back to the community.Gramz CannOver $20,000 in Flint bus passes to be donated for people seeking assistancePeople seeking support from some local non-profits can get a free bus ride during the holiday season.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)Comment on this story0CommentShare storySharetopics: Mortgage ratesPortable mortgagesHousing affordabilityLock-in effectHomeownershipHousing supplyMortgage-backed securitiesTariffsWASHINGTON (TNND) — The Trump administration is considering another method to bring down soaring housing costs through mortgage rates that are pricing people out of homeownership and keeping homes from coming onto the market.Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating “portable mortgages,” which would allow homebuyers to take their mortgage rate with them when they decide to move. The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.TrendingAmazon announces $15-billion data center investment coming to Northern IndianaMore data centers are coming to northern Indiana.Amazon announcing Monday a $15-billion dollar investment that is expected to bring more than 1,100 jobs to the McKinley Road closed after crash involving motorcycle in OsceolaOne person was taken to the hospital after a crash involving an SUV and a motorcycle in Osceola.McKinley Road is closed at this time between Ash and Birch RoadsMan arrested after jumping into St. Joseph River during police chase in South BendA man was arrested after police say he jumped into the St. Joseph River after a chase Monday afternoon in South Bend.A South Bend Police Officer on patrol said 117-year old barn at Potato Creek State Park demolished despite efforts to save itA piece of Potato Creek State Park\'s 117-year old history now gone.

That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.Meanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.TrendingCrash victim hit, killed while stepping out of vehicle to investigateA person who left their car after crashing on the Northway was hit and killed.State police say it happened just before 8:15 Sunday evening just south of Exit 11Woman who caused deadly crash while off seizure meds sentenced to prisonA woman who caused a deadly crash while off anti-seizure medication has been sentenced to 1⅓ to four years in prison.Indictment unsealed in the murder of veteran Daniel Frament; suspect pleads not guiltyAn indictment has been unsealed in the homicide investigation surrounding the death of Daniel Frament, the veteran who was killed on the Menands bike trail.Firefighters rescue woman trapped in submerged SUV in Skidmore College pondFirefighters rescued a woman whose vehicle became submerged in a pond on the Skidmore College campus Sunday afternoon.According to Saratoga Springs Fire Dept.

Airy. POWER Interfaith’s goal is to pressure City Council into intensifying efforts to address the current housing affordability crisis Philadelphia residents are facing. \nFaith leaders specifically focused on City Council’s June 12 decision to gradually reduce Business Income and Receipt Tax (BIRT), citing potential harm to the city’s working class and most vulnerable residents. \nThe BIRT tax is the third-largest source of tax revenue for the city, paid for by business owners or companies engaged in for-profit activity within the City of Philadelphia. The tax is not levied on residents who are not business owners. \n“Cutting business taxes is estimated to cost the city $2.8 billion over 12 years, removing significant dollars from the city budget and forcing residents to shoulder more of the burden,” Jayson Massey, a member of Germantown Friends Meeting, said at a press conference Saturday outside Germantown High School. \nHe added, “We are here today in front of the former Germantown High School to show the crisis of affordable housing in Germantown, and also to show that the loss of Germantown High School did not result in usable, safe, and affordable housing for the residents here in Germantown. This neighborhood, with a median income of only $45,727, does not need luxury apartments.” \nThe high school building, which closed in 2013, has been converted into an apartment complex called The Annex at Germantown, where rents begin at $1,050 for studio apartments, according to rent.com. \nAlong with Germantown and Greene Street Friends Meeting, Northwest faith groups and congregations joining the initiative to lobby for affordable housing include St.Vincent de Paul Catholic Church, Faith Chapel, Face to Face Germantown, Mishkan Shalom synagogue, First United Methodist Church of Germantown (FUMCOG), Second Baptist Church of Germantown, and Unitarian Universalists of Mt. Airy. \n\nOn Wednesday, Nov. 12, FUMCOG co-hosted one of the press conferences, with their senior pastor, the Rev. Alisa Lasater Wailoo, speaking on the issue of affordability. \n“When I arrived here about three years ago, I would say we got about two calls a week for folks in need. We’re now getting about a dozen calls a week, easily,” Wailoo said. “We get calls from young mothers. And it’s not just calls, members of our church, we have seniors who don’t know if they’re going to be able to turn on their heat. We have veterans who wonder about their medical bills. And we have working folks of every race, every gender, every orientation, and background that are struggling.” \nAt Saturday’s press conference in front of Germantown High School, several speakers and attendees joined the group of faith and civic leaders including City Councilmember Nicolas O’Rourke and Seth Anderson-Oberman, who ran against Councilmember Cindy Bass in 2023. \nO’Rourke, along with fellow Working Families Party City Councilmember Kendra Brooks, opposed the decision to phase out the BIRT tax. \n“There are very few issues that are as constant as the cost of housing and the terms on which you secure it,” O’Rourke said. “The city’s widest housing gap is the shortage of almost 65,000 units, affordable and available to those with the lowest incomes. That’s a problem.” \nHe then discussed what he described as a weakness in Mayor Cherelle Parker’s housing plan. \n“The mayor’s plan for housing, which I have said, and I will say again, does have its fair share of bright spots … But something a number of my colleagues and I have raised was the importance of codifying that most of the plan’s funding goes towards those making the least. Codifying it, not just stating an intention but writing that intent into the letter of the law,” O’Rourke said. “The administration flatly refused to do this a couple of times.” \nHe added, “We know there’s no housing gap for luxury apartments. You see them all over the place, and they’re good and empty … Everyone further up the income scale has a unit that’s available to them, though it may not be their dream apartment. It may not be the exact thing that they’re looking for; it may not hit all of their preferences. It may not be the perfect setup, but they can’t afford it. With this in mind, I simply don’t see why we aren’t being clear about working for those who simply don’t have an option that they can afford.” \nKadi Ashby, the president of the Alden Park Tenants Association, shared her experience as a tenant. When she organized the tenants group early this year, Ashby and her neighbors fought for better maintenance and responsiveness from their building’s management company. \nAfter months of organizing, she received an email from property management denying her a lease renewal, without providing a reason. \n“I am left unable to afford to move. I’m unable to find a comparable apartment in my neighborhood, and it’s possible that this will force me out of my community, the community that, through all of this, has shown me overwhelming support,” Ashby said. ‘We need all of our city council members to commit to fighting gentrification and the corporate landlords taking over our neighborhoods.” \nOne goal of O’Rourke’s office has been to push for better protections for renters, including a bill that would require “good cause” for denying a lease renewal. This effort would protect tenants who attempted to organize from retaliation. \nAnderson-Oberman, who is currently the executive director of the advocacy group Reclaim Philadelphia, ran on a progressive platform, narrowly losing to Bass in the 2023 Democratic primary. On Saturday, he discussed his own family’s struggle with affordability and the actions he believes the city must take to address the housing crisis. \n“The private sector alone, the so-called free market, is never going to solve this crisis. If the private sector were going to build deeply affordable housing for working-class families, they would have done it already,” Anderson-Oberman said. “That’s why our government — city, state, and federal — must step in and build the housing that we actually need. We need public investment. We need government-funded social housing that is mixed-income and permanently affordable.” \nWork ahead \nOn Feb. 1, Power Interfaith will host a Citywide Affordability Summit, inviting City Councilmembers to speak with faith leaders, advocates, and residents about a long-term solution to the shortage of affordable housing and other affordability issues. \nReflecting on the week of press conferences, Meg Cruz, the Northwest organizer for POWER Interfaith, told the Local, “I think it was a super powerful week of action where we saw over 20 of our congregations who were represented at these different press conferences. We had everyday people speaking out about how the affordability crisis impacted them and what the implications of this loss of [BIRT] funding would be like.” \nShe added, “This is a crisis that is really escalating at a scale that is impossible for people to withstand within their own means, and the decision to eliminate business taxes makes that worse.” \nTommy Tucker can be reached at Tommy@Chestnuthilllocal.com.  \n\n Other items that may interest you  \n\n  Faith leaders call for housing affordability and a …    \n\n  Community leaders react to mayor’s new …    \n\n  St. Martin-in-the-Fields helps resettle Afghan family    \n\n  New executive director of Bird in Hand strives for …         \n\nLocal Calendar \n\nThe Latest  \n \nA tribute to Rabbi Waskow Recently, I became aware of the passing of author, social activist Rabbi Arthur Waskow, who packed a lot of punch into his 92 years. \n\nRichard Allen Lane Station is a model of success The Richard Allen Lane Station was the first site along the Chestnut Hill West line to be leased to Ken Weinstein more than 20 years ago.

Credit: Chris Rycroft / Creative Commons\n\nHartford, CT – As the Connecticut Senate met Thursday to vote on a sweeping housing package, members of Carpenters Local 326 gathered outside the Legislative Office Building holding banners from job sites where the Department of Labor has issued stop-work orders for payroll violations, unpaid wages, and worker misclassification. Their message to lawmakers was blunt: the state can’t build affordable housing on exploited labor.\n\n“This is happening in all four corners of the state,” said Miguel Fuentes, president of Local 326 and a representative for the North Atlantic States Regional Council of Carpenters. He said out-of-state developers and contractors, from as far as Florida, are profiting from community redevelopment funds and tax abatements while cutting corners on labor.\n\n“They decide they’re going to build these projects on the cheap and not pay workers’ time, not pay unemployment, not pay workers’ comp, and not pay wages,” he said.\n\nThe demonstration coincided with the Senate’s special session to advance a housing bill designed to expand the state’s rental stock through zoning incentives, streamlined permitting, and new development subsidies. The House approved the bill Wednesday.\xa0\n\nWhile the proposal aims to accelerate construction, it contains no provisions addressing wage theft or labor misclassification — an omission unions say could undercut affordability goals before construction begins.\n\nFuentes said wage theft and misclassification have surged over the past two decades, particularly on publicly supported housing projects.\n\n“We’ve got skilled Connecticut workers ready to go, but contractors bring in out-of-state crews they can exploit. It drains wages and stability from our communities,” he said.\n\nRecent enforcement actions show the pattern. In East Hartford, three principals of ITO Construction and Hotel Renovation Solutions were arrested after investigators found they paid workers in cash and misclassified them on a Fairfield Marriott project.\xa0\n\nIn Meriden, subcontractors for A.R. Building Company drew eight stop-work orders after 50 workers went unpaid for nearly two months—roughly $150,000 in stolen wages—before one carpenter was killed on site.\n\nIn New Haven, the Labor Department halted work at Spinnaker Real Estate’s 34 Fair Street development for misclassifying employees. In Bridgeport and Hartford, inspectors cited contractors for payroll and insurance violations at major redevelopment projects.\n\n“These are real jobs, real violations, and taxpayers end up footing the bill,” Fuentes said.\n\nA recent advisory from the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network flagged construction as a high-risk industry for money laundering, tax fraud, and human trafficking. Construction workers, already struggling to make ends meet, are especially vulnerable.\n\nA UC Berkeley Labor Center study found 39% of Connecticut construction-worker families rely on public assistance. Misclassification drains thousands of dollars per worker in lost payroll taxes.\n\nNationally, between 1.1 and 2.1 million construction workers are misclassified or paid off the books each year — costing more than $12 billion in stolen wages and up to $10 billion in lost tax revenue.\n\nFuentes said unions have pushed stronger enforcement tools for three sessions, and lawmakers have begun to take notice. Earlier this year, Comptroller Sean Scanlon backed a bill that would allow his office to withhold payments from state contractors found violating wage laws after a 2024 audit uncovered nearly 1,000 wage-theft complaints stalled at the Department of Labor. The Senate approved the measure, but it died without a House vote before the 2025 session ended.\n\n“If there is a company that’s shortchanging workers, we’re gonna shortchange them,” Scanlon reportedly said at the time.\xa0\n\nUnion leaders are also pressing for contractor-liability legislation — already in place in 10 states — that would hold general contractors responsible for wage theft committed by subcontractors, suggesting a proposal that would apply to private projects with at least 15 units and include a 30-day window to correct violations without affecting municipalities.\n\n“If we want real affordability, everyone has to play by the rules,” Fuentes said. “Connecticut workers should earn enough to live in the homes they build. Do it right, and we fix problems. Do it wrong, and we multiply them.”\n\nRELATED\nLamont: ‘I Look Forward To Signing’ New CT Housing Bill Into Law\nKeep reading\nby Donald Eng\nNovember 14, 2025, 2:44 pm\nCT Senate To Take Up Housing, Hospital Bills In Special Session Today\nKeep reading\nby Donald Eng\nNovember 13, 2025, 5:00 am\nRevised CT Housing Bill Clears House After 7-Hour Debate\nKeep reading\nby Donald Eng\nNovember 12, 2025, 3:38 pm\nMassachusetts Considers Expanding Effort To Ban Gas In New Buildings\nKeep reading\nby Sarah Shemkus for Canary Media\nNovember 12, 2025, 4:45 am\nConnecticut’s Disappearing Farmland And What It Means For The Future\nKeep reading\nby Brian Scott-Smith\nNovember 11, 2025, 9:00 am\nCT’s New Housing Proposal Heads To Special Legislative Session\nKeep reading\nby Karla Ciaglo\nNovember 10, 2025, 5:00 am\nWith Homelessness Rising, CT Earmarks $8M To Help People Stay Warm\nKeep reading\nby Donald Eng\nOctober 10, 2025, 5:00 am\nUConn Students Face Housing Crunch As Enrollment Rises\nKeep reading\nby Julia Gillego, University of Connecticut / CT Community News\nOctober 9, 2025, 12:10 pm\nTagged:400pThursday,\xa0affordable housing,\xa0eng,\xa0Extra,\xa0Push,\xa0Sean Scanlon,\xa0State Senate,\xa0wages\nSPONSORED MESSAGES\n\nConnecticut Construction Industries Association – Shaping the Future of the Construction Industry\n\nOUR DIRECTORY PARTNERS\n\n© 2025 Your trusted, authentic, locally owned and operated news source at the state Capitol since 2005\nPowered by Newspack\nTerms of Service & Privacy Policy"", ""LOG IN   \n\nDay pass login \nCalendar submission login       \n\n MONDAY, NOVEMBER 24, 2025            \n\n Day Pass Log in     \n\n Toggle navigation      Main menu    \n\n  Home   \n  Our Towns   \n \n Barrington  \n Bristol  \n East Providence  \n Little Compton  \n Portsmouth  \n Tiverton  \n Warren  \n Westport    \n  News   \n \n All  \n Sports    \n  East Bay Life   \n  Obits   \n \n Recent Obituaries  \n Archived Obituaries  \n Place An Obituary    \n  Opinion   \n \n All  \n Columns  \n Letters  \n Editorials    \n  Classifieds   \n \n All  \n Automotive  \n Employment  \n Home Improvement  \n Items for Sale  \n Real Estate  \n Yard Sales  \n Place an ad    \n  Homes   \n \n New in the Market  \n Distinctive Homes    \n  e-Editions   \n \n This Week's paper  \n Special Issues    \nHousing un-affordability hits new high across Rhode Island \n\n Data from HousingWorks RI 2025 Factbook  \n\n Data from HousingWorks RI 2025 Factbook  \n\n Local housing affordability data for the state of Rhode Island as a whole.  \n HousingWorks RI 2025 Factbook  \n\n Local housing affordability data for Barrington.  \n HousingWorks RI 2025 Factbook  \n\n Local housing affordability data for Bristol.  \n HousingWorks RI 2025 Factbook  \n\n Local housing affordability data for Little Compton.  \n HousingWorks RI 2025 Factbook  \n\n Local housing affordability data for Portsmouth.  \n HousingWorks RI 2025 Factbook  \n\n Local housing affordability data for Tiverton.  \n HousingWorks RI 2025 Factbook  \n\n Local housing affordability data for Warren.  \n HousingWorks RI 2025 Factbook  \n       Previous    Next   \n\n Posted  Wednesday,  October 22, 2025  5:40 pm   \n \nBy Ethan Hartley \nThe cost to affordably buy a median-priced home, or rent a median-priced apartment, now far exceeds the income of the average person looking to do so. And that reality holds true whether you are looking to live in Woonsocket, Little Compton, or anywhere in between.\n\nThe 2025 Housing Fact Book, released last week by HousingWorks RI — a research hub based out of Roger Williams University in Bristol that strives to “inform public policy, develop communications strategies, and promote dialogue about the relationship between housing and the state’s economic future and residents’ well-being” — painted the bleakest picture of the state’s affordable housing situation yet.\n\n“In 2024…analysis noted the first time Rhode Islanders required an income of more than $100,000 to affordably buy a home in every Rhode Island municipality,” the report’s executive summary reads. “While that continues to be the case, this year it is now also true that renting—for the first time—requires an income that exceeds the renter median income ($48,434) to affordably rent in every municipality.”\n\nAccording to the fact book, the cost of a median-priced, single-family home in Rhode Island is now $475,000, requiring a monthly housing payment (on average) of $3,957. That represents a 64 percent increase over 2019, when the median-priced home was $288,792 in the state. For context, a $475,000 home would require a household income of $158,263 to afford. \n\nThe median household income of all Rhode Islanders, per the fact book, is $86,372. For homeowners, the median income was $112,858.\n\n“Based on 2024 median single family home prices, a household would need an annual income close to $130,000 to affordably buy a home in any Rhode Island municipality,” the report reads. “This exceeds the median household income by more than $40,000 and median owner income by more than $17,000.”\n\nThe rental situation is no sunnier.\n\nAccording to the data the average, two-bedroom rental in Rhode Island now costs $2,316 a month, representing a 16 percent increase over 2019, when the average rent was $1,988. A $2,316 per month rent would require a household income of $92,640 to afford without hardship.\n\nThe average annual household income for a renter in Rhode Island, meanwhile, is just $48,434.\n\n“Since 2018, wages have grown by less than 30 percent but housing costs in the Ocean State have increased by over 60 percent,” the report reads. “More recently, Rhode Island’s single family home prices have jumped higher and faster than anywhere else in the country and rental increases are currently the steepest in New England.” \n\nComparing prices\nThe most “affordable” place to buy a home in Rhode Island, per the data, is Pawtucket, which would require a $128,635 household income to buy a median-priced home. That is followed by Woonsocket, West Warwick, Central Falls, Warwick, Coventry, East Providence, North Providence, Cranston, and Burrillville to round out the top 10.\n\nBlock Island is by far the most expensive community to own a home, requiring a $521,723 annual household income to purchase a median priced home.\n\nThe top 10 most expensive communities (excluding Block Island) to buy a median-priced home in Rhode Island are: Jamestown ($357,068 annual income required); Newport ($307,638); Little Compton ($277,754); Narragansett ($265,655); East Greenwich ($264,823); Barrington ($249,379); Middletown ($226,456); Portsmouth ($219,420); North Kingstown ($208,277); and West Greenwich ($205,191).\n\nIn terms of East Bay municipalities, East Providence is the most “affordable”, requiring an income of $143,048 to but a median-priced home. That is followed by Tiverton ($149,159); Warren ($174,943); Bristol ($191,440); Portsmouth ($219,420); Barrington ($249,379); and Little Compton ($277,754).\n\nThe cheapest place to find a rental apartment, per the data, is Westerly (requiring a $60,320 income to affordably rent a two-bedroom apartment). That is followed by Woonsocket ($62,680); Central Falls ($67,520); Lincoln ($76,440); Pawtucket ($78,080); Bristol and East Greenwich (both $80,080); Newport ($81,960); Smithfield ($82,120); and Coventry ($83,520) to round out the top 10.\n\nEast Providence, in contrast to being the seventh-most affordable Rhode Island municipality to buy a home, was found to be the eighth-most expensive place to rent in Rhode Island, requiring an income of $94,800 to afford a two-bedroom apartment. \n\nFourteen municipalities, including Barrington and Little Compton, did not have sufficient rental data to be included in this ranking of rental costs. \nOne-third of households are cost burdened\nThe report found that, consistent with prior years, a full one-third of Rhode Island households (142,920 of 436,902 total) are “cost burdened”, meaning they spend more than one-third of their total annual income on housing costs. In the most recent data, they found that 44 percent of those cost-burdened households (62,237) are severely cost-burdened, meaning that they spend over 50 percent of their annual income on housing.\n\nThese figures get worse when separated by ethnicity. More than a third of Black home owners (35 percent) and Hispanic homeowners (39 percent) are cost-burdened, compared to 24 percent of white homeowners and 19 percent of Asian homeowners. \n\nThe data also reveals that it is not just young people looking for homes that aren’t making enough money. Nearly 30 percent of the more than 60,000 severely cost-burdened households in Rhode Island (18,475) are mortgaged homeowners with incomes under $68,000, commonly elderly people on fixed incomes. \n\nThe majority of severely cost-burdened households (37,466) are those without a mortgage, and renters making annual household incomes less than $40,000. \n\nHousing production is up, but more investment needed\nWhile the report recognizes that the Rhode Island legislature has spent the last three years passing numerous laws intended to boost housing production in the state in the hopes to better meet demand and drive down costs, the data also revealed that more work, and monetary investment, is needed.\n\nOn the good side, the report states that more than $330 million in pandemic-related funding went to the creation of more than 1,835 new affordable homes, enabling 1,672 people to become new homeowners, and the creation of 1,400 shelter beds for those experiencing homelessness. \n\nHowever, the report found that overall, more than 80 percent of the state’s $44 million in efforts to bolster affordable housing for the federal program year that ended on June 30, 2024 came from federal funding sources, creating a precarious situation when it comes to the future availability of those funds.\n\n“With…the uncertainty of future federal funding, it is crucial that state investments include permanent streams of revenue to continue forward momentum,” the report states. \n\nIt goes on to praise the recent creation of a five-year pilot program, infused with $30 million initially, to create a low-income housing state tax credit program, as well as the $120 million state housing bond that passed in the 2024 election.\n\nThe report showed that, while the state saw 2,818 total housing permits issued in 2024 (a 15 percent increase over 2023), a large chunk of that was due to a 25 percent increase in single-family home permits. \n\nMultifamily home permits, which do more to address the widespread need of housing, only increased by 3 percent in the same span. Furthermore, the state saw 130 fewer multifamily permits in Q1 of 2025 than in Q1 of 2024.\n\nAccessory dwelling units (ADUs), which since late 2024 have been made easier to be built by-right by homeowners to provide additional housing units on existing parcels, showed a significant albeit still small increase in the overall number of permits — from 28 in 2023, to 163 in 2024. \n\nOverall, the report showed that only eight municipalities in Rhode Island have achieved the state’s goal for each city and town to have 10 percent of its total housing stock be deemed “affordable”. Those municipalities are: Burrillville (10.19 percent); Central Falls (17.76 percent); East Providence (10.64 percent); Newport (17.27 percent); Pawtucket (10.41 percent); Providence (16.59 percent); West Warwick (10.6 percent); and Woonsocket (17.09 percent).  \n\n Other items that may interest you  \n\n  Waterfront favorite 15 Point Road is for sale    \n\n  Boys Town New England raises $7.5K for Thanksgiving    \n\n  Barrington Town Planner: No ‘feelings’ about …    \n\n  Townies hungry to win back-to-back over LaSalle on …       \n\n Click here to sign up ...     \n\nTrending  \n\nYour community.

Its price-per-square-foot of $167.55 also positions it well below national averages.\nDespite that affordability, the market is far from sluggish.\nPittsburgh posts a 35.5 Market Action Index (MAI), placing it in seller-leaning territory as the market carries just 2.5 months of inventory.\nMAI is HousingWire Data’s proprietary measure of market heat that ranges from 0–100 and gauges the balance between supply and demand.\nDeb Reddick, a Realtor at Pittsburgh-based REMAX 360 Realty, noted that demand is supported not just by low prices, but by strong fundamentals in the region.\n“One of the reasons people move here is we have excellent medical facilities, that makes people want to be here and it makes them feel like they’re in good hands,” she said. “We’re not seeing prices climb as high here as other places, and it’s hard to point to one or a few reasons why that is.\n“We’ve had a lot of building and improvement lately, too. The roads make it so if you live just outside of downtown, it’s not hard to get in. It’s all tied together nicely.”\nThe metro also reports a strong 10.2% weekly absorption rate — the highest among key metros reviewed — and a 4.4% year-over-year price gain, signaling healthy and sustainable appreciation.\nHomes average 63 days on market, and nearly half of active listings take price cuts, yet sellers still maintain leverage due to tight supply.\nReddick adds that Pittsburgh’s growth has remained measured in part because home values started from a lower base.\n“Well, I think, honestly, they were lower to begin with, and with them climbing they’re not keeping in line with the other cities,” she said. “We’ve also had a lot of new building and construction — a lot of new high rises and condos.”\nAustin’s inventory surge\nAustin, Texas, once among the most supply-constrained markets in the country, now posts one of the strongest inventory totals in the analysis with 10,867 active listings.\nWith 505 new listings added each week, Austin’s supply pipeline remains robust.\nInventory is up 19.1% year-over-year — the sharpest increase among major metros.\nDespite a recent 5.1% price dip, the market operates at a balanced MAI of 33.1, suggesting buyers have more choice than they did during the pandemic boom but still face competitive conditions.\nMatt Menard, broker-owner at ERA Real Estate Experts in Austin, notes how stark the shift has been from pandemic-era scarcity\n“We were certainly one of the hottest markets in the country during COVID, and during that period of time, we had an inordinate amount of growth and appreciation,” he said. “There was a time when our inventory levels were about a half a month or less, and then now we’re pushing five months of inventory and 80-plus days on the market.”\nHomes average 84 days on market and price-per-square-foot sits at $225.03.\nMenard emphasized that despite the cooling, the market remains active and offers opportunity.\n“We’re still seeing a relatively good sales pace,” he said. “Inventory is just hanging out there. The number of sales are still relatively strong.

Lower-priced homes are selling briskly, while higher-end listings linger, according to the latest HW Data.\nAffordable homes fuel pending sales\nAlabama’s entry-level homes are moving quickly. The state recorded 1,843 pending sales in its most affordable tier last week at a median price of $165,000 — well below the national entry-level median of $215,000. These lower-priced homes went under contract in a median of 42 days, a week faster than Alabama’s overall pending average of 49 days.\nActive inventory builds as higher-end homes linger\nAcross all price ranges, Alabama had 16,275 active single-family real estate listings last week with a median list price of $333,400. Homes still on the market carried a median age of 84 days, highlighting how higher-priced properties are moving more slowly.\nPending sales data reflects how quickly homes go under contract, while listings data shows the age of inventory still on the market. Together, they highlight both buyer activity and seller challenges.\nThe Altos Market Action Index registered 33, a level that generally favors sellers. The index compares the current rate of sales to available inventory, with 30 considered a balanced market. Higher numbers tilt toward sellers, while lower numbers tilt toward buyers. Still, Alabama’s longer listing times at higher price points suggest the seller’s edge isn’t universal.\nA divided market\nThe data points to two different realities. Budget-conscious buyers are driving activity in affordable segments, where homes sell faster and at lower prices. Sellers above the median price are facing longer timelines and more competition, often needing more attractive pricing to secure offers.\nWhat’s next\nAlabama’s housing market remains resilient, but the divide is widening. Affordable homes continue to sell quickly, while higher-end properties test seller patience.\nNationally, the same pattern is emerging as affordable homes drive demand while pricier listings cool.

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.Comment with BubblesREAD THE COMMENTS (11)Meanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.TrendingWashington state crackdown uncovers 41 unlicensed contractors in two-day operationIn a sweeping two-day enforcement operation, the Washington State Department of Labor & Industries (L&I) uncovered 41 cases of unlicensed contractors.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)Comment on this story11CommentShare storySharetopics: Mortgage ratesPortable mortgagesHousing affordabilityLock-in effectHomeownershipHousing supplyMortgage-backed securitiesTariffsWASHINGTON (TNND) — The Trump administration is considering another method to bring down soaring housing costs through mortgage rates that are pricing people out of homeownership and keeping homes from coming onto the market.Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating “portable mortgages,” which would allow homebuyers to take their mortgage rate with them when they decide to move. The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Comment with BubblesREAD THE COMMENTS (11)Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.TrendingWashington state crackdown uncovers 41 unlicensed contractors in two-day operationIn a sweeping two-day enforcement operation, the Washington State Department of Labor & Industries (L&I) uncovered 41 cases of unlicensed contractors.

Redfin agreed to transition clients to Zillow, incentivize its own sales staff to do the same, and display only Zillow\'s listings for large rental properties on its platforms.Prosecutors say this deal allowed Zillow to solidify its position as the dominant player in the multifamily rental listings market—at the expense of competition and consumer choice. Shortly after the agreement, Redfin reportedly laid off around 450 employees and shut down its rental listing operations.Attorneys general from Arizona, Connecticut, New York, and Virginia joined Washington in filing the suit. They allege the companies violated both the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Clayton Act by unlawfully eliminating competition and engaging in an anti-competitive acquisition.SEE ALSO | Amid housing affordability troubles, nearly 60% of young adults are \'rent burdened\'The lawsuit seeks a court order to unwind the agreement and restore competition in the online rental marketplace.The Federal Trade Commission also filed a related complaint against Zillow and Redfin in the same court.According to the lawsuit, Zillow began building its rental listings platform in the 2010s and expanded aggressively through acquisitions of rival platforms like HotPads and Trulia. Redfin, which entered the rental listing market in 2021 by acquiring RentPath—owner of Rent.com, ApartmentGuide.com, and Rentals.com—had competed fiercely until the two companies struck the deal in early 2025.Comment with BubblesREAD THE COMMENTS (10)As of Wednesday, neither Zillow nor Redfin had issued a public response to the lawsuits.TrendingWashington state crackdown uncovers 41 unlicensed contractors in two-day operationIn a sweeping two-day enforcement operation, the Washington State Department of Labor & Industries (L&I) uncovered 41 cases of unlicensed contractors.

But city leaders say what isn\'t rising fast enough are homes that people can afford.Milford Mayor Todd Culotta said many neighbors are spending too much on housing.""The rule of thumb is 30% of your income should be spent on housing. No more than that. And one out of three Sussex County people spend more than that on housing.""A recent city report shows Milford is adding roughly 200 new homes a year. At that pace, it would take 17 years to finish all approved projects and about 20 years to complete everything approved and proposed. City data estimates it would take 36 years to fully develop all currently vacant residential land within the city limits at the current rate.However, Culotta said the issue isn\'t growth — it\'s affordability.""We do not have an overgrowth problem in Milford. In fact, we have a housing crisis. And it\'s not just affordable housing. It\'s a housing crisis for everybody.""Slides presented to the council by Matthew Heckles of the Delaware State Housing Authority illustrated what affordability really means for families at different income levels, highlighting the limited options available to lower-income households.""I\'m talking about 30% of AMI, or we focus a lot on 50% of the area median income… that\'s about a $30,000-a-year income for a family. Which means you can only afford about $800 in rent in Milford. And there just aren\'t enough units like that.""Heckles said Milford is making strong investments and doing a good job, but the city still needs a wider mix of housing types to meet demand.""This is something that the council asked about, too… what kind of housing and what price point should we be looking at? And the answer is all of them.""With Delaware facing a shortfall of roughly 50,000 homes, Heckles said new construction must prioritize affordability.""I think what we need to do is think about how to develop more smartly, and make sure that the types of development that are going through are affordable homes.""After the workshop, Culotta said the city plans to revisit its master plan, review its layout, and make adjustments where needed, with a focus on mixed-use development.\nFacebook\nTwitter\nWhatsApp\nSMS\nEmail\nPrint\nCopy article link\nSave\n1:59\nLatest News\nCity leaders focus on housing affordability in Milford\nUpdated\nNov 20, 2025\nTags\nMilford City Council\nHousing Crisis\nAffordability\nDelaware State Housing Authority\nDevelopment\nWorkshop\nHomes\nAmi\nIncome\nInvestments\nDemand\nTiffani Amber\nVideo Journalist\nTiffani Amber joined the WBOC News Team in July 2024.\xa0She\ngraduated from The Catholic University of America with a Bachelors\nof Arts in Media and Communication Studies and a Bachelors of Music\nin Musical Theater.

Recognizing this, the Vacant Property Initiative was launched to tackle the inventory of unused or legally entangled parcels that are dragging down communities.\n\nThe Solution\nThe initiative zeroes in on vacant and under-utilised properties as a faster, more cost-effective way to restore housing supply, reduce blight and strengthen neighborhoods. Key components include:\n\nHiring a dedicated Vacant Property Development Manager to coordinate interventions like probate assistance, receivership, tax-foreclosure support and owner outreach.\nForming an inter-departmental Vacant Property Working Group across housing, code enforcement, inspectional services and treasurer’s divisions.\xa0\nDeploying a data-driven toolset: a Vacant Building Registry enhanced with a custom ESRI-based property-analysis dashboard drawing on municipal systems to provide a full snapshot of property condition, ownership status, liens, and vacancy indicators.\xa0\n\nWhy It Matters\nBy shifting the focus from only new construction to actively reclaiming existing vacant assets, New Bedford’s approach offers multiple benefits: reclaiming neglected properties, stabilising neighborhoods, improving housing availability and recovering tax revenue. Already, the city is recouping over $1 million in tax revenue and fines within the first eighteen months of the initiative.\n\nImpact & Measurement\nMetrics for the program include:\n\nTracking properties from vacancy to occupancy or active rehabilitation via the dashboard.\xa0\nFiscal returns: more than $1 million in recovered tax revenue and fines in the first 18 months.\nCommunity outcomes: cases moved out of extended vacancy, legal resolution of estates, and redemption of properties otherwise stuck in limbo.\xa0\nRead more.\n\nInfrastructure and Housing Impact Fund\nLead Author: Michael Frerichs, Treasurer – Illinois, IL\nCategory: Economic Opportunity & Affordability\n\nThe Challenge\nHousing and infrastructure serve as the backbone of thriving communities, yet investment in these sectors has declined across the country. At the same time, many regions face serious affordable-housing shortages and growing infrastructure demands—especially as emerging technologies place new stresses on energy, utilities and the built environment.\n\nThe Solution\nTreasurer Frerichs launched the FIRST Fund — a $1.5 billion impact investment vehicle dedicated to strengthening Illinois’ infrastructure and housing markets. Key features:\n\nThe fund is the\xa0first infrastructure-investment fund in a state treasury\xa0in Illinois.\xa0\nTarget: invest $1.5 billion to bridge the gap between development demand and available financing.\xa0\nThe fund invests up to\xa05% of the state’s investment portfolio, with about $250 million deployed annually in projects ranging from $25 million to $75 million.\xa0\nProjects focus on revenue-producing housing and infrastructure developments that deliver direct benefits to Illinois citizens.\nEmphasis on underserved communities: since launching in 2023, $490 million invested in total, with 64 % ($315 million) allocated to firms owned by minority, women, veteran and disabled asset managers. The underlying fund managers have invested roughly $2.1 billion into Illinois—about 4.3 times the state’s $490 million contribution.\xa0\n\nWhy It Matters\nBy deploying state-level capital into housing and infrastructure finance, the fund addresses two core bottlenecks: inadequate housing supply (especially affordable housing) and aging or insufficient infrastructure capacity. The model repositions the public-treasury role from passive investment to proactive, community-driven economic growth and local wealth creation. It aligns financial returns with measurable public and social benefit, offering a blueprint for other states.\n\nImpact & Measurement\nPerformance metrics are built directly into the fund’s framework:\n\nTotal capital invested and multiplier effect: $490 million invested by the fund since launch, supporting $2.1 billion total investment in Illinois (approx. 4.3×).\nProportion of funding to firms owned by traditionally under-represented groups: 64 % of the $490 million has been directed to minority, women, veteran, and disabled asset-managers.\nFuture tracking will include decreases in housing-supply deficits and the gap between energy/infrastructure capacity and demand, to validate the fund’s direct impact on community conditions.\xa0\nRead more.\n\nInnovative State Financing for Affordable Homeownership Development\nLead Author: Dylan Roberts, State Senator – Colorado, CO\nCategory: Building & Development / Economic Opportunity & Affordability\n\nThe Challenge\nAffordable homeownership remains out of reach for many low- and moderate-income households. Standard financing models often leave too little margin for builders and sellers to profitably offer homes at lower price points, driving up costs and limiting the supply of homes that qualified buyers can afford.\n\nThe Solution\nSenator Roberts’ bill creates a new tool through the Colorado State Treasurer: the state will invest in bonds issued by quasi-governmental agencies at below-market returns to finance the construction of affordable, for-sale homes. These homes will have permanent or long-term resale restrictions, and the financing structure is designed so that once constructed, the owner converts the construction loan into a 30-year conventional mortgage at a below-market rate. Because of the structure, buyers gain roughly 33 % more purchasing power.\n\nWhy It Matters\nThis financing innovation reduces the cost of construction and enables builders to offer homes at prices affordable to first-time and moderate-income buyers—without sacrificing long-term affordability or resale protections. By expanding homeownership access, the initiative strengthens households, neighborhoods and local economies in a model that could be replicated across states.\n\nImpact & Measurement\n\nA pilot program was seeded with\xa0$50 million\xa0in initial investment.\nMetrics to be tracked: number of homes built through the program; increase in affordability relative to conventional homes; conversion of construction loans into long-term mortgages; and buyer demographics (income, first-generation status, etc.).\nRead more.\n\nExpanding Affordable Housing Through Accessory Dwelling Units\nLead Author: Nicole Clowney, State Representative – Fayetteville, AR\nCategory: Building & Development / Economic Opportunity & Affordability\n\nThe Challenge\nMany communities nationwide are facing an affordable-housing crisis, with rapidly rising home costs making it difficult for middle- and lower-income families to find suitable housing. In some counties, home prices have surged by 65 % or more in the past five years, further limiting options for those who earn less.\n\nThe Solution\nThis initiative leverages the potential of Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs)—small secondary housing units such as backyard cottages, converted garages or nanny flats—to expand affordable housing supply on existing properties. The policy advances major reforms including:\n\nGranting\xa0every landowner on a single-family lot the right to build one ADU.\xa0\nLimiting municipalities from imposing\xa0excessive impact fees or use permits\xa0for ADU construction.\nStreamlining the development process to\xa0remove bureaucratic obstacles\xa0and make ADU development more accessible.\xa0\nBesides boosting supply, ADUs give homeowners more flexibility—providing rental income or housing for family members—while preserving neighborhood character and making efficient use of existing infrastructure.\xa0\n\nWhy It Matters\nBy empowering homeowners to create affordable “in-law” or secondary units on their property, this approach supports housing affordability without requiring large-scale new construction. ADUs bring multiple benefits: increasing rental unit supply, generating income for homeowners (especially older adults), and using infrastructure already in place—all while maintaining the feel of single-family neighborhoods.\n\nImpact & Measurement\nImplementation will be monitored in partnership with the state’s Municipal League. Metrics tracked will include the number of ADUs built and identifying municipal obstacles that remain in the way of widespread ADU development.\n\nRead more.\n\nLeveraging Public Land for Workforce Housing\nLead Author: County Supervisor – Santa Barbara, CA\nCategory: Building & Development / Housing\n\nThe Challenge\nCommunities across the United States are grappling with an affordable housing crisis: many people simply cannot afford to live where they work. In one county, over a one-year analysis of more than 6,000 acres of publicly-owned land, leadership identified sites such as a former government office building and a county-campus parking lot as high-potential for workforce housing.\nBecause land acquisition drives up costs and constrains speed of development, publicly-owned under-used buildings, vacant lots and idle parcels represent a missed opportunity.\n\nThe Solution\nThis initiative focuses on unlocking under-utilized public land in developed areas for affordable housing targeted at the local workforce. Key elements include:\n\nIdentifying publicly-owned parcels (including buildings, parking lots and vacant lots) in prime locations for affordable workforce housing.\xa0\nRemoving the cost of land acquisition from the development equation to reduce housing costs and enable faster delivery.\nPrioritizing residents who work in the community—such as food workers, school employees, young people and older adults—so they can live where they work.\xa0\nPreserving agricultural land and open space by building on already-developed public land rather than expanding into undeveloped parcels.\xa0\n\nWhy It Matters\nUsing government-owned land as a housing asset shifts the paradigm: rather than idle public parcels draining value, they become catalysts for workforce-housing solutions. This approach aligns housing access with local jobs, supports community stability, and protects open spaces by focusing on infill rather than greenfield development.\n\nImpact & Measurement\n\nLand-use conversion: tracking how many publicly-owned parcels are repurposed for workforce housing.\nAffordability and occupancy: measuring the number of units built affordable to local workers and filled by those residents.\xa0\nPreservation of open land: quantifying acres of agricultural or open land spared because housing was built on public sites.\nRead more.\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nEmail\nPrint\nThe NewDEAL @NewDEALLeaders\nThe NewDEAL @NewDEALLeaders\nSEE MORE STORIES BY THE NEWDEAL @NEWDEALLEADERS\nStay on top of the latest state & local government news.\n\nPapers\nWebinars\nPodcasts\nSponsored Articles\nAbout\nPrivacy & AI\nContact\nAdvertise\nStay Up To Date\nGet smart with Governing.

(Loveland Planning Commission documents)\nBy Jocelyn Rowley | jrowley@prairiemountainmedia.com | Loveland Reporter-HeraldPUBLISHED: October 24, 2025 at 10:20 AM MDT Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...There might not be easy answers to Loveland’s affordable housing crisis, but that doesn’t mean there are no answers.\nOn Thursday, about 40 people gathered at the Mirasol Event Center to learn more about the challenges in the local housing market with three of the people working hardest to overcome them:\xa0 Jeff Feneis, executive director of the Loveland Housing Authority; Jammie Sabin, co-owner of Aspen Homes of Colorado; and Alison Hade,\xa0the city’s community partnership administrator.\nThe two-hour event was co-hosted by the League of Women Voters and the city’s Affordable Housing Task Force. It began with the basics — what constitutes affordable housing and why there is a lack of it in Northern Colorado.\nAccording to Julie Stackhouse,\xa0a LWV member and\xa0 a retired executive vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, “affordable housing” often means different things to different people, but there are some official parameters for it set by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nPer HUD, a household’s housing is considered affordable when it costs less than 30% of gross income. For a household earning $5,000 a month, that translates to no more than $1,500\xa0in rent or mortgage payments, plus utilities.\nBut housing priced at that point is very hard to find in the Fort Collins-Loveland area these days due to population growth over the last several years that has outstripped the supply of available units. As a result, Stackhouse told the audience, the median sales price of a single-family home has quadrupled since 1995 to $580,000.\nContinuing, Stackhouse said that escalating input costs for construction are also driving high housing prices, mostly thanks to the high cost of water.\n“Water is a big deal here, and not just because water is scarce and expensive,” she said. “It’s because, depending on which water company you’re working with, you’re going to have a different set of criteria to abide by.”\nAfter the table was set with the data, the three panelists took turns answering questions about what the city is doing right to alleviate the housing crisis and what remains to be done.\nTo the first question, both Feneis and Sabin praised the city’s efforts to be an active partner in finding solutions through the task force, which was formed in 2021 and tasked with expanding housing options for working families.\nBoth also said that close collaboration between developers, builders and the city had been the key to several affordable projects in Loveland, such as Legacy Crossing, a 60-acre neighborhood near Taft Avenue and 57th Street being developed by the Housing Authority in partnership with three homebuilders. When completed, it will include roughly 330 homes serving families from 40 percent to 120 percent\xa0of the area median income.\n“I do feel very fortunate that we’re in Loveland in the support that the affordable housing community has received is tremendous,” said Feneis. “And I’m optimistic a lot of the work that’s been happening the last three, four years through the task force, which couldn’t happen without the city’s involvement, is starting to come to fruition.”\nHade outlined several recent policy changes designed to reduce costs, including fee waivers for affordable units and a “scalable” fee model that adjusts water and utility fees based on home size. Beginning in January, Loveland will become the first city in Colorado to adopt that model. Smaller homes will also pay proportionally lower capital-expansion fees, which fund parks, police and other infrastructure.\n“These policies took a lot of time and hard work to develop,” Hade said. “It’s been a lot of really good work and a great collaboration with city departments.”\nStill, the city faces obstacles, notably an out-of-date comprehensive plan that complicates approval of mixed-density or nontraditional housing developments, according to Hade.\n“The comprehensive plan should be updated every 10 years,” Hade said. “It’s overdue, and we don’t have the money to do it. That’s an obstacle to producing the kind of housing people want.”\nAnother, panelists agreed, is community resistance.\n“Everyone wants affordable housing in Loveland,” Sabin said, “but a lot of people don’t want it next to them. We have a large NIMBY contingent that is vocal and organized.”\nHe urged residents who support new housing to counterbalance that opposition by speaking up at public hearings.\n“Your voice matters,” he said. “You don’t have to be an expert — just show up and say this is the kind of project we need.”\nAudience questions touched on the role of metro districts, manufactured housing and accessory dwelling units (ADUs), as well as Proposition 123, a state program requiring participating cities to increase affordable housing stock by 3 percent per year to qualify for construction funding.\nWhile none of the speakers claimed there was a silver bullet, all three emphasized that Loveland is moving in the right direction, even if the journey will be a long one.\n“From my perspective, the Affordable Housing Task Force and the city staff have been working for the last several years, and the impact of that is just about to get to the market next year and the year after and then you’ll start seeing some real changes,” Sabin said.\nShare this:\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook\nClick to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX\nRevContent Feed\nEvents\nMost PopularMost PopularAsking Eric: Family punished for missing wedding 50 years laterAsking Eric: Family punished for missing wedding 50 years laterDirt likely to fly starting in 2026 on NISP water projectDirt likely to fly starting in 2026 on NISP water projectNorthern Colorado home day care owner charged with child abuseNorthern Colorado home day care owner charged with child abuseThings to do in the Loveland area Monday, Nov. 24: Christmas open house; All is Bright light showThings to do in the Loveland area Monday, Nov. 24: Christmas open house; All is Bright light showCSU quarterback Darius Curry suspended for unsportsmanlike conduct against Boise StateCSU quarterback Darius Curry suspended for unsportsmanlike conduct against Boise StateA new era: Loveland Mayor Pat McFall aims to restore order and rebuild trustA new era: Loveland Mayor Pat McFall aims to restore order and rebuild trust‘Berthoud Deserves a Vote’ campaign puts downtown project in jeopardy‘Berthoud Deserves a Vote’ campaign puts downtown project in jeopardyThings to do in the Loveland area Sunday, Nov. 23: Holiday lights, Garrison KeillorThings to do in the Loveland area Sunday, Nov. 23: Holiday lights, Garrison KeillorDriver killed in westbound I-70 crash near PalisadeDriver killed in westbound I-70 crash near PalisadeUpcoming in the Loveland area: train show, concerts and moreUpcoming in the Loveland area: train show, concerts and more', ""NewsPolitics\nTwo Denver suburbs take different paths as residents face housing crunch: ‘We can manage it, but just barely’\nLakewood barrels forward with zoning changes, while Littleton battles residents' density pushbackShare this:\nClick to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook\nClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\nReddit\nA residential neighborhood near the corner of South Harlan Street and West Jefferson Place in Lakewood on Friday, Sept. 26, 2025. (Photo by Hyoung Chang/The Denver Post)\nBy John Aguilar | jaguilar@denverpost.com | The Denver PostPUBLISHED: October 5, 2025 at 6:00 AM MDT Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...Two suburban cities south and west of Denver find themselves on distinctly different tracks in addressing a long-vexing problem — the high prices and elevated borrowing costs that box out young families and renters of all ages from buying a home.\nIn Lakewood, elected leaders spent the summer overhauling the city’s zoning code and land use rules. Their goal: to encourage the building of more varied housing types, and by extension greater density, in the city of 156,000, with the ultimate aim of lowering overall home prices.\nIn Littleton, a similar pro-density effort had sparked a furious backlash earlier this year. Now a citizen-initiated measure is bound for the Nov. 4 ballot and, if passed, it will restrict a large chunk of the city from having anything but single-family homes — a stark pivot from city leaders’ prior goal.\nEach city is part of a larger density debate that has played out in communities across metro Denver and has dominated housing affordability discussions at all levels, from the Colorado statehouse to neighborhood streets.\nLittleton City Councilwoman Andrea Peters, who is also a real estate agent, said the lack of “missing middle” housing in her city is having a chain-reaction effect on younger families seeking their first home as well as older people looking to downsize. That type of housing includes duplexes, triplexes and attached townhomes, which are designed to house more people per square foot but are less imposing than hulking apartment buildings or condos.\n“We have an aging demographic and we don’t have a plan for younger families,” Peters said. “If we have more smaller-size options (for downsizers), that frees up that larger home for someone else.”\nMark Harris, an eight-year resident of Littleton, is part of a group dubbed Rooted in Littleton that is behind Measure 3A on this fall’s ballot. He says the goal is to stop the city from shoehorning certain housing types into neighborhoods where they don’t fit and where residents don’t want them.\nMark Harris, left, and Joe Whitney, who are leading an anti-density movement in Littleton, stand outside a newly built triplex in Littleton on Sept. 25, 2025. (Photo by RJ Sangosti/The Denver Post)\n“Our intent is to preserve single-family land use — that’s what we’re trying to do,” he said. “We are not anti-growth. We are not anti-affordable housing. We just don’t want duplexes, triplexes and quadplexes imposed on us.”\nAs high-level discussions on affordability have taken up much of the oxygen in policy debates in recent years, the issue has been tackled in the state Capitol. A collection of bills passed in 2024 and signed into law by Gov. Jared Polis was designed to increase higher-density living and bring home prices down.\nSeveral Front Range municipalities have, in turn, sued the state, claiming its mandate to implement zoning-related changes encroached on their home rule powers to set their own land-use rules.\nAnd at the center of it all is raw emotion.\n“This place doesn’t resemble what it used to be — not at all,” said Regina Hopkins, a lifelong Lakewood resident who feels the growth in her city over the last couple decades has been out of control. “Why are local governments being forced to fix what is a state issue?”\nHopkins, 40, and others in Lakewood are exploring whether to put their own measure on the ballot to roll back what the city is expected to finalize on Oct. 13.\nBut for newcomer Robert Adams, Lakewood is doing the right thing. At 39, he finally got out of the rental game by purchasing a 1,200-square-foot, 1950s-era home in the city.\n“After my years of renting, we bought 2½ years ago — and it’s quite a burden to afford a moderately-priced home,” he said.\nWhile home prices have finally stagnated across metro Denver in recent months, they haven’t come down much from their record levels. The median price gain of a residential property sold in August in metro Denver was 0.3% compared to the same month a year earlier, rising to $587,000, according to a recent report from Homes.com. That was below the 2.4% annual price gain seen nationally, the site said.\nIn August 2021, when values were surging, metro Denver home prices rose 17.4% compared to a year earlier.\nWhile some experts say the local housing scene has flipped to a buyer’s market, high mortgage rates are keeping things tough for those on the hunt for a listing. Adams paid $650,000 for his Lakewood house, and he carries a 6.6% interest rate on his loan.\n“We can manage it, but just barely,” he said.\nNeed for ‘missing middle’ housing\nThe Lakewood City Council has already approved three rounds of updates to the city’s zoning code. Those include measures allowing diverse housing stock anywhere in the city, limiting new home sizes to 5,000 square feet, and encouraging the conversion of vacant or underused commercial buildings to housing.\nCouncil members will cast one last vote Oct. 13 on a final zoning map. The new rules will go into effect on Jan. 1.\n“Right now, Lakewood is an infill city and there’s not a lot of housing stock coming online,” Adams said. “The supply and demand effect is real. The core idea of this zoning update is that it allows more units to be built — it creates more units for people who are desperately looking for a house.”\nRobert Adams stands in front of his home in Lakewood on Friday, Sept. 26, 2025. (Photo by Hyoung Chang/The Denver Post)\nLakewood Mayor Wendi Strom said the overhaul had taken much of the council’s time in recent months. She remembers adjourning one council meeting just before 3 a.m. in September as its members dissected and analyzed dense zoning code documents deep into the night.\nThe process, she said, isn’t going to make everyone in the city happy.\n“This is their home — these are the roofs over their heads,” Strom said. “And it can be concerning what’s happening on the lot next to yours.”\nBut the mayor has also heard impassioned pleas from young families that just can’t crack the overinflated market. Supporting the development of more housing options will help those young families as well as older residents, teachers, firefighters and first-time homebuyers, she said.\n“We have seen a level of concern from young people about the changes not being made,” Strom said. “Right now, we have way more demand than supply.”\nAccording to the Lakewood Strategic Housing Plan, released in early 2024, planners estimated that the city would need at least 5,800 new homes built over the next 10 years to satisfy anticipated demand.\nAt the metro level, the Denver Regional Council of Governments concluded in a September 2024 report that an area encompassing slightly beyond the Denver area would need 216,000 new housing units — whether houses or apartments or other multifamily units — by 2032.\nFifty-two thousand of them would cover the current shortage, while 164,000 of that total represent new units needed in the future, DRCOG concluded.\nHouses now larger — and more expensive\nMax Nardo, a housing and smart growth senior associate with the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, said the status quo simply wasn’t working. His organization has been following the Lakewood code updates closely.\n“Cities in Colorado are dealing with the same housing crisis, and many are looking at the same solutions — smaller homes on smaller lots,” he said.\nLakewood’s housing assessment report concluded that nearly three-quarters of households in the city had just one or two people. It also noted that the average single-family home built since 2000 had about 2,600 square feet of space — much larger than houses built decades earlier — and sold for more than $1.1 million.\n“It’s a ridiculous mismatch with what the city really needs,” Nardo said.\nA home is under construction at 6400 W. Exposition Ave. in Lakewood on Friday, Sept. 26, 2025. (Photo by Hyoung Chang/The Denver Post)\nBut Lakewood has seen at least one major institutional protest to its plans. The Green Mountain Water and Sanitation District, which serves 10,000 accounts, accounting for 48,000 residents in Lakewood, wrote a letter to the city in August. It warned that “densification” of the city’s housing stock could compromise the district’s ability to provide adequate service.\nKaren Morgan, the district’s president, told The Denver Post that the district had to plan for the long term.\n“We are already overcapacity with our sewer pipes,” she said. “We do not have the infrastructure to handle that density, especially since we don’t know when it’s happening.”\nA potential harbinger of what could emerge in the wake of Lakewood’s update might exist in Portland, Oregon, where city leaders undertook a similar effort to encourage denser residential construction a few years ago, Nardo said.\nA review of outcomes from that initiative found that between August 2021 and June 2024, the city permitted more than 1,400 accessory dwelling units — which typically include garage apartments and granny flats — and middle housing units, which the report described as duplexes to cottage clusters. The most common middle housing unit built during that period in Portland was a two-bedroom home weighing in at a cozy 900 square feet.\nMost notably, according to the report, the average sale price of one of those new market-rate middle housing units in 2023 and 2024 was about $250,000 less than the price of a new single-family detached house.\nAdams, the new homeowner in Lakewood, said today’s housing market is far different from what it was when many homeowners who are wary about the city’s initiative bought their properties.\n“They bought in at a time when it was more affordable, and they are scared that it’s going to change overnight,” he said. “But if they look at other places that have done this, it’s a slow process.”\nThat gives little comfort to folks like Hopkins, 40, who took a lead in opposing the construction of a five-story apartment complex on the edge of Belmar Park in recent years. That project, she feared, would ruin the feel of a natural oasis in the middle of Lakewood. The developer overcame that fight and is now proceeding toward construction.\n“One of the reasons I oppose the code changes is that a neighborhood’s character will completely change,” she said. “They’re trying to urbanize and gentrify Lakewood. They are just trying to increase density.”\n‘All that does is gentrify’\nIn Littleton, Joe Whitney says building more units won’t necessarily translate to lower home prices. Prices are struck on more than just the availability of housing stock, he says. They also depend on construction costs and what is profitable for the builder.\nHe points to a recently built triplex on South Sycamore Street that offered little price relief to those looking for a home in Littleton, despite the building offering more living units than the single-family homes surrounding it. According to online records from the Arapahoe County Assessor’s Office, the three attached units were purchased for between $980,000 and $1.15 million — prices well above the metro area median.\n“All that does is gentrify — it doesn’t improve affordability,” Whitney said of the new construction. “The last thing we want to see is Littleton turn into Lakewood.”\nHousing economists and advocates for more density point out that there’s more complexity at play in the housing market. They argue that the building of high-end units still reduces overall pressure on rents and housing prices as residents of lower-cost homes upgrade, moving out and making those older units available.\nBut the gentification concern is why Rooted in Littleton chose to try and preempt the city from doing what Harris called another “sneak attack” on the city’s residents. That’s the term he uses to characterize the contretemps that occurred in January, when the council abandoned an attempt to welcome denser housing types in the city after blowback from the community.\nThe ballot measure, if approved by voters next month, would keep the council from bringing other types of housing to single-family neighborhoods, which Harris said cover nearly half of Littleton’s land mass.\nNothing, however, would stop homeowners from requesting permission from the city to build nonconforming structures on their lot.\n“We’re not trying to tie the hands of individual property owners — we’re trying to tie the hands of a City Council that just wants density,” he said.\nMail ballots for Littleton’s election will go out beginning Friday.\nPeters, the Littleton councilwoman, worries about the fiscal impact on Littleton if the measure ends up passing. The governor, in August, signed an executive order that threatened to withhold grants from cities that refuse to follow the new state housing laws.\nIf Littleton’s hands are tied by the restrictions laid out in the ballot measure, Peters said, “it means we’ll be out of compliance with the state and ineligible for grant money.”\nColorado Municipal League Executive Director Kevin Bommer said what’s playing out today in Littleton and Lakewood strikes on a familiar theme, “especially when the pressure to grow comes head-to-head with the desire to preserve the character of a community.”\nBut Bommer, a vocal opponent of state interference in municipal decisions, said “these difficult conversations are happening exactly where they are supposed to be,” at the city level.\n“Local control — or local decision-making — isn’t always pretty, but it is the best way to solve local challenges and talk about the future,” he said. “This is precisely how things need to happen.”\nGet more Colorado news by signing up for our daily Your Morning Dozen email newsletter.\nShare this:\nClick to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook\nClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\nReddit\nRevContent Feed\nEvents\nMost PopularMost PopularMan arrested for going 130 mph on U.S. 34 in GreeleyMan arrested for going 130 mph on U.S. 34 in GreeleyDowntown Greeley to jumpstart holiday fun with 3 weeks of ‘Winterfest’Downtown Greeley to jumpstart holiday fun with 3 weeks of 'Winterfest'Weld County retail food inspections reportsWeld County retail food inspections reportsCSU quarterback Darius Curry suspended for unsportsmanlike conduct against Boise StateCSU quarterback Darius Curry suspended for unsportsmanlike conduct against Boise StateDirt likely to fly starting in 2026 on NISP water projectDirt likely to fly starting in 2026 on NISP water projectUNC football gets ‘huge win’ over Portland State in final game of the seasonUNC football gets 'huge win' over Portland State in final game of the seasonColorado man pleads guilty to murder in Limon prison strangulation, claimed attack was ‘what child molesters get’Colorado man pleads guilty to murder in Limon prison strangulation, claimed attack was ‘what child molesters get’Great Western Industrial Park seeks to annex 325 acres into GreeleyGreat Western Industrial Park seeks to annex 325 acres into GreeleyDriver killed in westbound I-70 crash near PalisadeDriver killed in westbound I-70 crash near PalisadeArty’s Pantry hands out Thanksgiving meals with help from Weld Food BankArty's Pantry hands out Thanksgiving meals with help from Weld Food Bank"", ""NewsPoliticsNewsNews Based on facts, either observed and verified directly by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\nTwo Denver suburbs take different paths as residents face housing crunch: ‘We can manage it, but just barely’\nLakewood barrels forward with zoning changes, while Littleton battles residents’ density pushbackShare this:\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook\nClick to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)\nReddit\nClick to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX\nA residential neighborhood near the corner of South Harlan Street and West Jefferson Place in Lakewood on Friday, Sept. 26, 2025. (Photo by Hyoung Chang/The Denver Post)\nBy John Aguilar | jaguilar@denverpost.com | The Denver PostPUBLISHED: October 5, 2025 at 6:00 AM MDT Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...Two suburban cities south and west of Denver find themselves on distinctly different tracks in addressing a long-vexing problem — the high prices and elevated borrowing costs that box out young families and renters of all ages from buying a home.\nIn Lakewood, elected leaders spent the summer overhauling the city’s zoning code and land use rules. Their goal: to encourage the building of more varied housing types, and by extension greater density, in the city of 156,000, with the ultimate aim of lowering overall home prices.\nIn Littleton, a similar pro-density effort had sparked a furious backlash earlier this year. Now a citizen-initiated measure is bound for the Nov. 4 ballot and, if passed, it will restrict a large chunk of the city from having anything but single-family homes — a stark pivot from city leaders’ prior goal.\nEach city is part of a larger density debate that has played out in communities across metro Denver and has dominated housing affordability discussions at all levels, from the Colorado statehouse to neighborhood streets.\nLittleton City Councilwoman Andrea Peters, who is also a real estate agent, said the lack of “missing middle” housing in her city is having a chain-reaction effect on younger families seeking their first home as well as older people looking to downsize. That type of housing includes duplexes, triplexes and attached townhomes, which are designed to house more people per square foot but are less imposing than hulking apartment buildings or condos.\n“We have an aging demographic and we don’t have a plan for younger families,” Peters said. “If we have more smaller-size options (for downsizers), that frees up that larger home for someone else.”\nMark Harris, an eight-year resident of Littleton, is part of a group dubbed Rooted in Littleton that is behind Measure 3A on this fall’s ballot. He says the goal is to stop the city from shoehorning certain housing types into neighborhoods where they don’t fit and where residents don’t want them.\nMark Harris, left, and Joe Whitney, who are leading an anti-density movement in Littleton, stand outside a newly built triplex in Littleton on Sept. 25, 2025. (Photo by RJ Sangosti/The Denver Post)\n“Our intent is to preserve single-family land use — that’s what we’re trying to do,” he said. “We are not anti-growth. We are not anti-affordable housing. We just don’t want duplexes, triplexes and quadplexes imposed on us.”\nAs high-level discussions on affordability have taken up much of the oxygen in policy debates in recent years, the issue has been tackled in the state Capitol. A collection of bills passed in 2024 and signed into law by Gov. Jared Polis was designed to increase higher-density living and bring home prices down.\nSeveral Front Range municipalities have, in turn, sued the state, claiming its mandate to implement zoning-related changes encroached on their home rule powers to set their own land-use rules.\nAnd at the center of it all is raw emotion.\n“This place doesn’t resemble what it used to be — not at all,” said Regina Hopkins, a lifelong Lakewood resident who feels the growth in her city over the last couple decades has been out of control. “Why are local governments being forced to fix what is a state issue?”\nHopkins, 40, and others in Lakewood are exploring whether to put their own measure on the ballot to roll back what the city is expected to finalize on Oct. 13.\nBut for newcomer Robert Adams, Lakewood is doing the right thing. At 39, he finally got out of the rental game by purchasing a 1,200-square-foot, 1950s-era home in the city.\n“After my years of renting, we bought 2½ years ago — and it’s quite a burden to afford a moderately-priced home,” he said.\nWhile home prices have finally stagnated across metro Denver in recent months, they haven’t come down much from their record levels. The median price gain of a residential property sold in August in metro Denver was 0.3% compared to the same month a year earlier, rising to $587,000, according to a recent report from Homes.com. That was below the 2.4% annual price gain seen nationally, the site said.\nIn August 2021, when values were surging, metro Denver home prices rose 17.4% compared to a year earlier.\nWhile some experts say the local housing scene has flipped to a buyer’s market, high mortgage rates are keeping things tough for those on the hunt for a listing. Adams paid $650,000 for his Lakewood house, and he carries a 6.6% interest rate on his loan.\n“We can manage it, but just barely,” he said.\nNeed for ‘missing middle’ housing\nThe Lakewood City Council has already approved three rounds of updates to the city’s zoning code. Those include measures allowing diverse housing stock anywhere in the city, limiting new home sizes to 5,000 square feet, and encouraging the conversion of vacant or underused commercial buildings to housing.\nCouncil members will cast one last vote Oct. 13 on a final zoning map. The new rules will go into effect on Jan. 1.\n“Right now, Lakewood is an infill city and there’s not a lot of housing stock coming online,” Adams said. “The supply and demand effect is real. The core idea of this zoning update is that it allows more units to be built — it creates more units for people who are desperately looking for a house.”\nRobert Adams stands in front of his home in Lakewood on Friday, Sept. 26, 2025. (Photo by Hyoung Chang/The Denver Post)\nLakewood Mayor Wendi Strom said the overhaul had taken much of the council’s time in recent months. She remembers adjourning one council meeting just before 3 a.m. in September as its members dissected and analyzed dense zoning code documents deep into the night.\nThe process, she said, isn’t going to make everyone in the city happy.\n“This is their home — these are the roofs over their heads,” Strom said. “And it can be concerning what’s happening on the lot next to yours.”\nBut the mayor has also heard impassioned pleas from young families that just can’t crack the overinflated market. Supporting the development of more housing options will help those young families as well as older residents, teachers, firefighters and first-time homebuyers, she said.\n“We have seen a level of concern from young people about the changes not being made,” Strom said. “Right now, we have way more demand than supply.”\nAccording to the Lakewood Strategic Housing Plan, released in early 2024, planners estimated that the city would need at least 5,800 new homes built over the next 10 years to satisfy anticipated demand.\nAt the metro level, the Denver Regional Council of Governments concluded in a September 2024 report that an area encompassing slightly beyond the Denver area would need 216,000 new housing units — whether houses or apartments or other multifamily units — by 2032.\nFifty-two thousand of them would cover the current shortage, while 164,000 of that total represent new units needed in the future, DRCOG concluded.\nHouses now larger — and more expensive\nMax Nardo, a housing and smart growth senior associate with the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, said the status quo simply wasn’t working. His organization has been following the Lakewood code updates closely.\n“Cities in Colorado are dealing with the same housing crisis, and many are looking at the same solutions — smaller homes on smaller lots,” he said.\nLakewood’s housing assessment report concluded that nearly three-quarters of households in the city had just one or two people. It also noted that the average single-family home built since 2000 had about 2,600 square feet of space — much larger than houses built decades earlier — and sold for more than $1.1 million.\n“It’s a ridiculous mismatch with what the city really needs,” Nardo said.\nA home is under construction at 6400 W. Exposition Ave. in Lakewood on Friday, Sept. 26, 2025. (Photo by Hyoung Chang/The Denver Post)\nBut Lakewood has seen at least one major institutional protest to its plans.

It warned that “densification” of the city’s housing stock could compromise the district’s ability to provide adequate service.\nKaren Morgan, the district’s president, told The Denver Post that the district had to plan for the long term.\n“We are already overcapacity with our sewer pipes,” she said. “We do not have the infrastructure to handle that density, especially since we don’t know when it’s happening.”\nA potential harbinger of what could emerge in the wake of Lakewood’s update might exist in Portland, Oregon, where city leaders undertook a similar effort to encourage denser residential construction a few years ago, Nardo said.\nA review of outcomes from that initiative found that between August 2021 and June 2024, the city permitted more than 1,400 accessory dwelling units — which typically include garage apartments and granny flats — and middle housing units, which the report described as duplexes to cottage clusters.

Some analysis suggests Austin is the city most impacted by the company\'s algorithmic system.Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesWhen the U.S. Department of Justice sued RealPage and six of the largest rental property landlords in the nation over alleged price fixing\xa0— illegal price gouging\xa0— it came to light that Austin was among the cities where the company’s property management software had been most used.Several of the companies the Justice Department sued along with RealPage manage tens of thousands of rental units in the city. The list includes GreyStar, Camden Property Trust, Cortland Management and Willow Bridge Property Co. Agreements they have with Richardson-based Realpage likely harmed competition and pushed up rental prices, the government said in court documents.AdvertisementArticle continues below this adA Washington Post analysis identified Austin as the city most impacted, with 46% of multifamily units being managed by landlords using RealPage’s artificial intelligence-driven system.FROM JANUARY: Texas-based landlords accused of price-fixing rents, DOJ lawsuit claimsThe company says both that study and another, which ranked Austin fifth among AI rent-pricing markets, were flawed. It said the studies’ authors didn’t have the company’s data and used faulty assumptions. It hasn’t released data to substantiate that.Statesman LogoWant more Statesman?Make us a Preferred Source on Google to see more of us when you search.Add Preferred SourceBut RealPage has been adamant its software has been maligned and misunderstood.AdvertisementArticle continues below this adRichardson-based RealPage says its system is misunderstood by attorneys, states and cities that say it’s responsible for keeping rents high. The U.S. has accused it of illegal price fixing.Lola Gomez/Tribune News Service“Unfortunately, much of the debate has been fueled by serious misrepresentations about how revenue management software actually works and the value it provides for both housing providers and renters,” Jennifer Bowcock, RealPage senior vice president of communications, said in an emailed response to questions. “Related legislative activity has been animated by biased political efforts to claim quick wins.”\xa0The suit and others targeting RealPage stem from use of the company’s AI-based revenue management software, which allows landlords to share information on rents, vacancies, and other nonpublic data with each other. The software can then suggest higher rents, helping landlords present a united front rather than competing for customers through concessions or lower rents, according to the Justice Department.The company’s software\xa0— which court documents show some executives called “classic price fixing”\xa0— was popular, gobbling up 80% of the market. \xa0AdvertisementArticle continues below this adThe company set up a website to address the criticism it’s faced since the suit and others were filed. It says increases in rental prices are caused by an undersupply of housing units and inflation, not its software and analytics.Broader impactBut now RealPage, once the toast of corporate landlords, is facing public criticism, bans in some states and former clients that say they will help the Justice Department prosecute the software giant. Many landlords have settled other cases related to their use of the system for millions of dollars.The resolution of the federal case could impact Austin’s tight housing market and what residents pay for rent.AdvertisementArticle continues below this adThen-U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland speaks with reporters in August 2024 about an antitrust lawsuit against real estate software company RealPage.Mark Schiefelbein/Associated Press file photoLegal experts say it’s a bellwether case for future algorithmic price-gouging schemes in other industries, too. The use of similiar practices by hotels and health insurance providers has also been alleged. That means the outcome of the RealPage case could have wider impacts.\xa0“It’s very important,” said Bill Baer, former director of competition at the Federal Trade Commission and U.S. assistant attorney general over antitrust. “Hopefully it will return to consumers the benefit of real competition for rental apartments.”Last year the Biden Administration estimated the average additional cost to consumers of AI-price coordination was $70 per month of rent nationally, or $3.8 billion. In Dallas, it was estimated the system was costing renters $136 extra each month. It provided no specific estimate for Austin.AdvertisementArticle continues below this adBut Austin has long struggled with housing affordability. Price surges in the past decade made it one of the most costly cities to rent in. And only recently has it felt relief as rental prices fell the past two years. But it’s still nearly 17% higher than pre-pandemic levels, according to Zillow.\xa0“Lack of supply is the root cause of the housing affordability crisis,” RealPage stated on its website. In a statement they note Austin’s prices only fell when housing supply grew.What’s alleged?The Justice Department and 10 state’s attorneys general said in a 115-page civil court filing that RealPage software allowed the nation’s biggest landlords to share nonpublic data about vacancy rates, leasing prices and costs then made recommendations on how to maximize profits to the detriment of consumers. Rather than run promotions and drop prices to get customers, landlords using the software might keep apartments off the market, and prices up, or suggest higher rents in a coordinated effort.AdvertisementArticle continues below this adRealPage has denied it ever recommended keeping apartments off the market and maintains its product doesn’t break the law.\xa0RealPage collects information from its clients that lawsuits allege have kept rents high in cities including Austin.Ken Ellis/Houston Chronicle illustrationThe algorithmic-suggestions essentially took away all competition, the DOJ said, replacing the smoke-filled back rooms of old with digital databases and dashboards\xa0— and giving massive property owners plausible deniability, Baer said.\xa0“It gives the companies who submit data and get back recommended pricing … [the ability to say] ‘Well, I didn’t do it, The algorithm just did it. It’s just math. It’s not collusion,’ ” he said. “No, it’s using an algorithm to collude.”AdvertisementArticle continues below this adCortland Management settled with the government in January over its 80,000 units. Greystar, which owns and manages nearly a million units in the United States also settled \xa0two months ago for $50 million. It said it wouldn’t share the sensitive, nonpublic data again or use such algorithms, and that it will help the government’s prosecution of RealPage.\xa0Companies that settled with the government are helping the government’s case, Baer said.\xa0“They have provided very incriminating evidence that this kind of collusion was intentional and was happening a whole lot,” he said.\xa0That isn’t the only bad news for the $10 billion company. Cities in multiple states have banned the use of AI-rent setting and 22 states have considered or are considering legislation banning software like RealPage. New York\xa0— the only state to have passed a law\xa0— signed it into effect last month.AdvertisementArticle continues below this adIn September, RealPage settled with the state of Nevada. It made no admission of wrongdoing and was able to continue using nonpublic data to generate rent recommendations as long as they were based on data that was three-months old and anonymized.The company is fighting back, too. It sued the city of Berkeley, Calif., over its ordinance banning the software, saying it was “prompted by an intentional campaign of misinformation and often-repeated false claims about the company’s revenue management software.”Austin rentsAustin rents have been declining for more than a year after an apartment building boom increased supply and drove down prices. But rents are still high enought that, according to a Harvard University study last year, more than half of the region’s renters are cost burdened\xa0— meaning they’re spending more than 30% of their income on housing.\xa0AdvertisementArticle continues below this adThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development estimated that the fair market rental rate for an efficiency in the Austin-Round Rock metropolitan statistical area in 2015 was $681. In 2025 it was $1,549\xa0— an increase of 127%.\xa0According to the Justice’s Department’s complaint, RealPage is designed to keep rents artificially high regardless of market forces. Court documents imply markets like Austin that have seen some relief on rents, may have been more affordable without RealPage’s involvement.\xa0Quoted in court documents, RealPage information appears to support that assertion: “Our tool … ensures that [landlords] are driving every possible opportunity to increase price even in the most downward trending or unexpected conditions.”\xa0\xa0K Agbebiyi, senior housing campaign coordinator at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, said its data shows that rents for the poorest residents have been affected more than those for other economic groups.\xa0AdvertisementArticle continues below this ad“It’s going to be the poorer tenants that are largely hit by these rent prices,” they said.Online tools allow would-be renters to search for aparements and rental rates.AndreyPopov/Getty ImagesBut Agdebiyi rejected the idea that simply banning RealPage would reverse rising housing prices. While the organization has said RealPage is harmful to the rental landscape, it agrees the company has been scapegoated. That’s because the issues of affordability go far beyond RealPage’s control, including the rise of private equity in rental markets, the project says. But RealPage is an easier target for people to understand, they said.\xa0“I think instead it’s easier for states to be like, ‘Oh, well, rent is really high because of this, like, boogie man,’ "" Agdebiyi said of cities and states that are going after the company.AdvertisementArticle continues below this adAI-fueled gougingRent rates are not the only costs for which AI-price gouging has been alleged. The Justice Department has said the use of algorithmic technologies used by competitors to coordinate decision making “poses a growing threat to the free market.”“It’s not limited to the rental housing market,” Baer, the former Justice Department official, said. “The fact is it may well be that this is just the tip of the iceberg.”\xa0\xa0The department says, for example, that a company called\xa0MultiPlan Inc is using such tools to drive down the amount it reimburses health providers for services. It says hotels are doing it to drive up prices in Las Vegas. Researchers have found AI-collusion in the financial markets.

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.Comment with BubblesBE THE FIRST TO COMMENTMeanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.TrendingGynecologist who worked at multiple hospitals accused of recording, touching 50 patientsA gynecologist who worked at multiple hospitals was accused by over 50 patients of secretly recording and inappropriately touching them.Late-night altercation at Lakeview Country Club leaves one man stabbed, suspect chargedLAKE VIEW, Ala.

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.Comment with BubblesBE THE FIRST TO COMMENTMeanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.TrendingMan arrested for car break-ins at Lithia Chevrolet in ReddingPolice arrested a they said committed a burglary early yesterday morning at Lithia Chevrolet in Redding.Crews contain Paradise house fire to garage and attic, cause under investigationCal Fire firefighters were sent to a home fire early Monday morning in Paradise, leading to an multi-hour long investigation.Cal FirSiskiyou County Sheriff\'s investigate vehicle burglaries in Mount ShastaThe Siskiyou County Sheriff\'s Office is investigating a series of vehicle burglaries that took place on the morning of Nov. 10.Report: Tyson to close large meat plant just weeks after Trump\'s collusion claims Tyson, one of the nation\'s largest meat packing companies, is planning to close a large meat packing plant in Lexington, Nebraska.New California wolf pack raises Sheriff\'s concerns over CDFW\'s communicationLaw enforcement officials are responding to the announcement of a new gray wolf pack in Plumas County.NEWS IN PHOTOS:""Local""3Redding begins $3 million water pump station project on Cypress Avenue4Saturday Forecast: Warm, sunny weekend begins3Bomb Burgers hosts fundraiser for Stuff the Bus toy drive4New California wolf pack raises Sheriff\'s concerns over CDFW\'s communicationACCESSIBILITYTerms & ConditionsCopyright NoticesKRCR EEO Public File ReportFCC Info - KRCRFCC Applications - KRCRPublic File AssistanceKAEF EEO Public File ReportFCC Info - KAEFFCC Applications - KAEFFCC Info - KCVUFCC Applications - KCVUFCC Info - KBVUSinclair California LicenseeFCC Applications - KBVUContactContestsNewsWeatherSportsStationGame CenterPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyDo Not Sell or ShareCookie Preferencestwitter iconfacebook icon 2025 Sinclair, Inc.', 'Redding Chico EurekaNewsNewsRedding Public Market opens Tuesday after years of anticipationAfter a 7-year-long project, the Redding Public Market will finally open its doors on Tuesday, Nov. 25.There was a friends and family gathering over the past weLocal agencies unite at Chico State for comprehensive emergency response training exerciseLocal law enforcement and first responder agencies collaborated in a training exercise at Chico State to prepare for real-life emergency scenarios on Monday.&ldquo;WhCHP launches Thanksgiving holiday enforcement, focusing on seat belt safetyAs the holiday season gets closer, the California Highway Patrol (CHP) is beginning their Thanksgiving Holiday Enforcement Period (HEP).The HEP will begin on WCalifornia to enforce full plastic bag ban in grocery stores by JanuaryStarting Jan. 1, California will enforce a complete ban on plastic bags in grocery stores, requiring shoppers to use paper bags instead.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)Comment on this story0CommentShare storySharetopics: Mortgage ratesPortable mortgagesHousing affordabilityLock-in effectHomeownershipHousing supplyMortgage-backed securitiesTariffsWASHINGTON (TNND) — The Trump administration is considering another method to bring down soaring housing costs through mortgage rates that are pricing people out of homeownership and keeping homes from coming onto the market.Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating “portable mortgages,” which would allow homebuyers to take their mortgage rate with them when they decide to move. The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.TrendingGovernor Newsom appoints new Shasta County Superior Court judgeGovernor Gavin Newsom has appointed Patrick Deedon as the Shasta County Superior Court judge.The governor\'s office said Deedon has been a partner at Maire & DeMan arrested for car break-ins at Lithia Chevrolet in ReddingPolice arrested a they said committed a burglary early yesterday morning at Lithia Chevrolet in Redding.Siskiyou County Sheriff\'s investigate vehicle burglaries in Mount ShastaThe Siskiyou County Sheriff\'s Office is investigating a series of vehicle burglaries that took place on the morning of Nov. 10.Crews contain Paradise house fire to garage and attic, cause under investigationCal Fire firefighters were sent to a home fire early Monday morning in Paradise, leading to an multi-hour long investigation.Cal FirCalifornia to enforce full plastic bag ban in grocery stores by JanuaryStarting Jan. 1, California will enforce a complete ban on plastic bags in grocery stores, requiring shoppers to use paper bags instead.

The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.\nMany homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.\n\nHomes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.\n\n“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”\n\nAllowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.\nBut it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.\n“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.\nPortable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.\nPulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.\nThe 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.\n\nThe administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.\nA shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.\nHousing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.\nTariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.\nTariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.\n\nTrending\n\nKinston police ask public for help identifying woman in stolen credit card investigation\nThe Kinston Police Department is seeking the public\'s assistance in identifying a woman connected to a stolen credit card case.Anyone with information is urged\n\nGreenville woman arrested for assault with deadly weapon\nYorling Valdez-Medina, 33, was arrested on Friday, November 21 at 11:44 a.m. by Greenville police at the 2400 block of Charles Blvd. in Greenville, N.C.

The builder simply gets access to a lower-cost loan through the local government in exchange for being allowed to carry out a project that local planners want to see. But even if this won’t bankrupt a town or county, it still reveals a misguided approach to “affordable housing.”If officials really want to make housing affordable in their areas, giving up this desire to micromanage the “planning process,” not pressing it further, is what will actually begin to attack the problem.To start with the positive, there really are some good trends. A lot of North Carolina’s more populous areas have loosened the restrictions on “single-family” zoned areas. Rather than just one dwelling per lot, city and county governments have been moving toward allowing things like accessory dwelling units (called ADUs or granny flats) and multi-family “missing middle” housing like duplexes, townhomes and quads.But even if they allow more variety and density in formerly single-family zoned areas, some government planners are not nearly as flexible if you want to build outside of designated urban areas.For a drastic comparison on this front, we can look at two Triangle-area counties, Orange and Wake. Wake has largely allowed building and now has multiple new major municipalities that were small towns at best just one generation ago (Morrisville, Cary, Rolesville, Knightdale, Apex, etc.).Orange County, on the other hand, has such strict local zoning rules that most of the county is locked in time. Chapel Hill had 26,199 people in 1970, while Cary had only 7,686. But the estimated populations for 2025 are 62,043 for Chapel Hill and 181,838 for Cary. So Chapel Hill, which had been the much bigger and more well-known city, basically doubled, while Cary grew 24 times larger — now bigger than not just Chapel Hill, but all of Orange County.And outside city limits, Orange County has grown even less. This is largely due to the county’s obsession with strict planning, as seen in its current “Comprehensive Land Use Plan.”The plan says that “per North Carolina General Statute 153A-121,” the county is authorized to “define, regulate, prohibit or abate acts, omissions or conditions detrimental to the health, safety or welfare of its citizens.”And county leaders take this authority in a very broad sense, saying that “this Comprehensive Plan will strive, in its implementation, to link the economy, the environment and social equity to improve the vitality of all three of these domains.”So, in short, they believe they can determine how all land in the county should be used and why (to achieve certain progressive social and environmental goals). To display just how extreme this is in practice, see the map of the areas where development is allowed and where it is severely limited. That bottom southeastern corner is where Chapel Hill/Carrboro is, and the area along I-85 is where Mebane, Hillsborough and a small portion of Durham are. The planners have decided that everything else should be left (permanently?) rural.Most of this land is designated low-density “rural residential,” while the area between the two largest population centers of Chapel Hill/Carrboro and Hillsborough (inside the yellow lines) is an even stricter “rural buffer,” despite that being the most obvious place to develop in a growing county. So, basically, if you want to build much of anything in the county, unless it’s in one of the approved human-activity zones, you’re probably out of luck.Even if you are a community of progressive artists and musicians who want to use a 90-acre property to create an environmentally conscious communal-living development for those 55-plus, where 60 of those acres are permanently set aside for natural conservation, you can’t — because that would “threaten the character of rural Orange County.” Fiddlehead Corner, the project in question, purchased its land and sought to build everything in as eco-friendly way as possible, but, in March, the developers were still denied.“The Orange County Board of County Commissioners unanimously denied the rezoning requested for H4D that would have allowed us to proceed with our plan to build Fiddlehead Corner as a clustered community on the Morrow Mill property,” said an update on the community’s website. “Several commissioners commented that the master plan was good, even wonderful. But their statements expressed concern that our proposed way of implementing the plan — expanding a rural activity node and siting a community there — sets a precedent that could lead to widespread imitation, which they fear would threaten the character of rural Orange County.”In a recent opinion piece in the Daily Tar Heel defending the “rural buffer” amid Orange County’s plan-updating process, the author noted that when the popular ice cream spot Maple View Farms “was bought out in 2021 by a cast of crooks” who “attempted to bastardize the sacred soil of Maple View Farms” with “a hotel and amphitheater with a capacity rivaling the scale of the Durham Performing Arts Center. The one thing that stopped this project from continuing? The Rural Buffer.”So this “buffer” not only prevents much-needed housing from being built, it also prevents a beloved landmark between Hillsborough and Chapel Hill from expanding and adding more attractions? Victory, I guess (mostly for those who already have the housing they need and don’t like fun).Because of the difficulty and humiliation in having to deal with “the planners,” many make decisions that allow them to avoid them altogether. A couple of years ago, I noticed that a whole stretch of lots in rural Orange County were exactly 10.01 acres and asked a real estate agent friend about why that would be. She explained to me that there is a state law that exempts landowners from most local subdivision and planning requirements if they split the land into lots greater than 10 acres.In growing urban regions like the Triangle, even if some think farms are beautiful to drive by, agriculture is no longer the “highest and best use” of the land. If a farmer sees that his land value has skyrocketed and wants to sell to a developer to build housing, which has become the highest and best use, he can’t, unless he goes to a planning department (who will tell him no, since it would violate rural character).So instead, he chops his 80-acre farm into eight 10-acre “estate” lots. Does it really “preserve rural character” and save farmland to have these eight lots owned by people with no interest in farming and who now have to mow massive lawns? Might it not be better for these aims to allow the farmer to sell off 10 1-acre lots and potentially keep the other 70 acres as a farm?(And a broader question: Would moving that statewide exemption from 10 acres to 1 acre add a lot more buildable land, thereby reducing building costs and increasing housing stock without major negative trade-offs? Somebody else can answer that one.)While my county is fairly extreme on this front, the same principle applies across the state. Officials look out across their jurisdiction like Mufasa from Pride Rock and begin the intoxicating process of planning what should be done with others’ land. “This part of town really should have more woods.” “The lots are too small (or big) on that street.” “A grocery store over there would be kind of an eyesore.” “I like all the farmland I see on my commute. It should stay that way.” And on and on.But they don’t always consider whether this should be their call to make — whether the Fiddlehead Corner community should have to align with their vision for the county, whether a farmer who wants to buy a bigger farm in a cheaper part of the state should be prevented from selling his land to a housing developer.\nYet somehow, these same commissioners frequently bemoan the lack of affordable housing. But a few government-planned “affordable housing” projects cannot make up for all of the private projects that have been blocked. There’s a much easier and cheaper way to make housing affordable: stop trying to control the process and let the market create the housing it needs.David Larson is managing editor of the John Locke Foundation’s Carolina Journal, where this column first appeared.AdvertisementRelatedColumnsNov. 24A $42 million investment in Wilson and its childrenColumnsNov. 2425 things I’m thankful for in 2025ColumnsNov. 24Whatley cheers ICE’s Charlotte invasionColumnsNov. 24Community ties boost social mobility', ""Image of home construction site is Creative Commons via PixaBay.\nThis week, the Local Government Commission, chaired by Republican state Treasurer Brad Briner, approved over $370 million in bonds around the state for affordable housing and retirement homes.\nIn a press release, Briner said, “Affordable housing remains a challenge in North Carolina, and the Local Government Commission (LGC) continues to fulfill its role in attacking the problem,” while also noting that the LGC “has a statutory duty to approve most debt issued by units of local government and public authorities in the state,” as long as they can show the debt amount is appropriate and the local government unit “can reasonably afford to repay the debt.”\nThankfully, these bonds were mostly “conduit revenue bonds,” where the financial risks are borne by the private builder and their bondholders, not the government.

As the Carolina Journal reported shortly after the bill received final passage on September 24, “HB 307 tightens pretrial conditions for the release of violent offenders, eliminates cashless bail, establishes a new protocol for ordering mental health evaluations in the criminal justice system, and sets a firmer timeline for appeal in death penalty cases.”“For too long, activist judges and magistrates have turned dangerous criminals loose, endangering lives and spreading chaos in our communities,” said North Carolina House Speaker Destin Hall (R) following the passage of HB 307, which Governor Josh Stein (D-N.C.) is still considering. “That ends now. Iryna Zarutska’s murder is a tragic reminder of what’s at stake. That’s why we are delivering some of the strongest tough-on-crime reforms in North Carolina history.”“The bill eliminates cashless bail for certain offenses, restricts judicial discretion in granting pretrial release, and creates a new category of ‘violent offenses’ requiring GPS monitoring, house arrest, or secured bond for those accused,” noted the Carolina Journal. “It also mandates mental health evaluations in specific cases, tightens deadlines on death penalty appeals, and adds committing a capital felony on public transportation to the list of aggravating factors that can make a defendant eligible for the death penalty. Republican leaders say the changes are designed to ensure violent and repeat offenders remain off the streets while holding magistrates more accountable for release decisions.”Reforms to reduce crime and increase public safety are a high priority for the White House and in many statehouses beyond North Carolina. While North Carolina’s HB 307 and similar proposals elsewhere aim to reduce crime, a less advertised benefit of such reforms, some influential voices are noting, is that they make affordable housing stock that was previously unsuitable for many households a viable option for families. Palmer Luckey, the tech titan who founded Oculus VR and Anduril Industries, recommended in an August 18 post on X that the “fastest way to lower average housing prices in American cities is enforcing the law/reducing criminal activity.”“Huge chunks of high-density housing are trapped in Bad Neighborhoods, no-go zones depressed well below nearby prices,” Luckey added. “Nobody with options even considers them.”Chris DeRose, an Arizona real estate developer who previously served as senior counsel to the state attorney general, says Luckey is “absolutely accurate.” “The best zoning reform couldn’t add housing nearly this fast,” he added.MORE FOR YOULeading politicians across the country, in both blue and red states, speak frequently about the historically high cost of housing and proposals that make housing more affordable, particularly for young and working class families. That talk has been accompanied by action in some states, with lawmakers in a number of red and blue states passing deregulatory reforms in recent years aimed increasing the supply of housing and reducing its cost to households. As the Pew Foundation recently highlighted, reforms that strengthen property rights and allow more housing to be built have helped alleviate rising rents and home prices in fast-growing cities like Raleigh, Austin, Nashville, and Denver. Locally-enacted reforms that strengthen property rights, as well as state preemption of local zoning restrictions that impede or block the development of new housing, are permitting the number of housing units to grow faster than would otherwise be the case in many places. Yet there are still a number of other ways in which federal, state, and local lawmakers can take action to make housing more affordable. Some housing cost mitigation proposals are less intuitive than the zoning reforms and property tax relief bills that lawmakers have pursued in recent months and years. One such proposal, which is currently being considered by the White House and congressional leaders for inclusion in the next reconciliation package, is the indexation of capital gains for inflation.Setting aside that fact that nobody is in a place to determine how big or small of a house another person or family needs, many baby boomers continue to reside in houses whose size exceeds their perceived needs for a host of reasons. Michael Batnick and Ben Carlson, professional wealth managers who cohost the podcast Animal Spirits, recently discussed the backlash and anti-baby boomer sentiment generated online in response to a recent survey finding that “61% of boomers never plan to sell their homes.”“Why would they?,” Batnik asked rhetorically, pointing out that there is no logical reason that freeing up housing stock for younger buyers should be a motivating factor for older homeowners to put their house on the market. “What are they supposed to do?,” Carlson added, “where are they supposed to go?”Batnik and Carlson are correct that it’s irrational for lawmakers or anyone to expect baby boomers, or home owners of any age, to sell a house that they still like living in, and in many cases own outright, just so strangers can have a chance to live there. Indexing capital gains for inflation, however, creates a significant financial incentive for older homeowners who might not otherwise consider downsizing or capitalizing on a long held asset that has appreciated greatly over two or three decades.Since inflation accounts for a considerable share, in some cases most of the gain in the value of homes that many baby boomers have been in for decades, indexing capital gains for inflation would significantly reduce the tax owed when baby boomers go to sell their house. Creating such a strong incentive for empty-nesters to downsize would help free up housing stock that is well suited for younger and larger families‘Inflation Tax’ On Homes Contributes To The U.S. Housing Affordability Crisis“The fact is, Boomers with smart financial advisors won’t sell their empty nester family homes due to the taxes they would pay—much of it on merely inflationary gains,” says Ryan Ellis, an IRS-enrolled agent who runs a tax preparation firm. “They’re being advised to die still owning the homes, so that their kids can inherit them tax free and with stepped up basis. Meanwhile, Millenial and Gen Z families looking for their ‘forever homes’ have fewer options to buy. The tax code’s ‘inflation tax’ on homes is a contributor to America’s housing inventory crisis.”Indexation of capital gains for inflation would be a boon to homeowners as well as those invested in the stock market, which includes the majority of American households. Inflation accounts for a notable portion of most capital gains. In some cases, the entire gain is attributable to inflation. The lack of inflation indexing for capital gains forces many Americans to pay taxes on inflationary stock gains and even when there has been no real gain at all. In making the case for capital gains to be indexed for inflation, Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) offers the following example:“A taxpayer that purchases one share of Coca-Cola stock in 1998 would have paid $32.38 per share. Today, that share would be worth $48.13 with a gain of $15.76 and a tax liability of $3.75. However, because of inflation, the value of a dollar in 1998 is worth $1.56. The inflation adjusted value of the stock is therefore $50.50 and the taxpayer has an inflation adjusted loss of $2.38.”Some leading Democrats used to be in favor of indexing capital gains for inflation. “If we really want to increase growth, there are proposals that we can do,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), then a congressman, said in a 1992 House floor speech, adding that he “would be for indexing all capital gains and savings and borrowing.”There is contextual basis for indexing of capital gains for inflation and legal precedent indicates that such a change can be made by executive action. ATR notes that “the IRS already makes inflation adjustments for over 60 tax provisions every year including adjusting individual income tax brackets, the standard deduction, and the Earned Income Tax Credit.”“In addition, the authority to index capital gains taxes is based on existing legal precedent as outlined in legal memos (see here and here),” ATR adds. “According to these studies the cost basis of an asset when calculating the capital gains tax does not necessarily mean historical cost.”Though there is a strong case that the Trump administration can unilaterally index capital gains for inflation by administrative action, many would like to see Congress codify that change. Doing so would ensure that indexation of capital gains for inflation could not be easily undone by a future administration, providing the certainty needed for this change realize its economic growth-boosting potential.The need to rectify the housing affordability crisis remains a high priority across the U.S., particularly in the nation’s fastest growing locales. Fortunately for lawmakers seeking to address the matter, there are a broad array of reforms in the prospective policy toolkit from which to choose, many of which are complementary reforms primarily aimed at other laudable goals, such as crime reduction and tax relief.

Puskar)\nWhite House’s 50-year mortgage proposal draws heavy criticism\nThe Associated Press//November 12, 2025//\nListen to this article\nThe Blueprint\nThe White House is considering a 50-year mortgage to improve housing affordability.\nEconomists say the plan won’t fix issues like limited housing supply or high rates.\nBorrowers could pay nearly $389,000 more in interest than with a 30-year loan.\nCritics note most Americans wouldn’t live long enough to pay off a 50-year mortgage.\nNEW YORK — The White House says it is considering backing a 50-year mortgage to help alleviate the home affordability crisis in the country. But the announcement drew immediate criticism from policymakers, social media and economists, who said a 50-year mortgage would do little to resolve other core problems in the housing market, such as a lack of supply and high interest rates.\nBill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said on X over the weekend that a 50-year mortgage would be “a complete game changer” for homebuyers. FHFA is the part of the federal government that oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which buy and insure the vast majority of mortgages in the country.\nThe 30-year mortgage is a uniquely American financial product and the default way to buy a home since the New Deal. Politicians and policymakers at the time wanted to create a standardized mortgage that borrowers could afford and pay off during their working years, when the average lifespan for an American was 66 years old.\nLower payment\nExtending the life of a mortgage to 50 years does decrease a borrower’s monthly payment.\nThe average selling price of a home in the U.S. was $415,200 in September, according to National Association of Realtors. Assuming a standard 10% down payment and an average interest rate of 6.17%, the monthly payment on a 30-year mortgage would be $2,288 while the payment on a 50-year mortgage would be $2,022. That’s presuming a bank would not require a higher interest rate on a 50-year mortgage, due to the longer duration of the loan.\nBut significantly higher interest\nBecause even more of the monthly payment on a 50-year mortgage would go toward interest on the loan, it would take 30 years before a borrower would accumulate $100,000 in equity, not including home price appreciation and the down payment. That’s compared to 12-13 years to accumulate $100,000 in equity when paying off a 30-year mortgage, excluding the down payment.\nA borrower would pay, roughly, an additional $389,000 in interest over the life of a 50-year mortgage compared to a 30-year mortgage, according to an AP analysis.\nOther analysts came to a similar conclusion.\n“Extending a mortgage from 30 years to 50 years could double the [dollar] amount of interest paid by the homebuyer on a median priced home over the life of the loan and significantly slow equity accumulation,” wrote John Lovallo with UBS Securities.\nBroader housing issues\nA 50-year mortgage does nothing to solve one critical issue when it comes to housing affordability — the lack of supply of homes. States like California and cities like New York have recently passed legislation or made regulatory changes to allow builders to build homes faster with less regulatory red tape.\nThere’s also the raw cost of homebuilding in the country. Products such as steel, lumber, concrete, copper and plastics that go into home construction are now subject to tariffs under President Trump. Further, many construction jobs were being done by undocumented workers, particularly in the Southwest, where deportations are impacting the ability for homebuilders to find enough labor to build homes.\n“Many of the big things that would address supply right now are going in the wrong direction,” said Mike Konczal, senior director of policy and research at the Economic Security Project.”\nPulte said on X that the introduction of a 50-year mortgage was just a “potential weapon,” among other solutions the White House has considered to combat high housing prices.\nAmericans don’t live long enough\nThe average age of a first-time homebuyer has been creeping up for years and is now roughly 40 years of age. A 50-year mortgage would be difficult to underwrite for a bank for a 40-year-old first-time homebuyer, who would be 90 years old by the time that home is paid off. The average life expectancy of an American is now roughly 79 years, meaning there’s 11 years of life expectancy not covered in a 50-year loan.\n“It’s typically not a goal of policymakers to pass on mortgage debt to a borrowers’ children,” Konczal said.\nOthers have tried longer loans\nOther parts of the financial system have extended loan terms, to mixed results. The seven-year auto loan has become increasingly common as car prices have risen and Americans keep their cars longer. Despite longer loan terms, auto loan delinquencies have been rising, and the average price of a new car is now $49,740 compared to a price of $38,948 for a new vehicle five years ago.\nStudent loans were originally designed to be paid off in 10 years, and now there are multiple payment options that extend repayment out to 20 years.\nEconomists pointed out that a 50-year mortgage may do the opposite of helping with home affordability by causing home price inflation by introducing more potential buyers into a market struggling with supply.\nTrump downplays idea\nAfter significant criticism, President Trump seemed less enthused about the 50-year mortgage. When asked by Laura Ingraham of Fox News about the idea, President Trump said it “might help a little bit” but seemed to brush it off.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act, the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac cannot insure a mortgage that is longer than 30 years, so any 50-year mortgage would be considered a “non-qualifying mortgage” and would be more difficult to sell to investors. Congress would have to amend U.S. financial laws in multiple places to allow for 50-year mortgages, and there seems to be little appetite for Congress to take this on immediately.\nTags:\nPresident Trump, Fannie Mae, housing affordability, mortgage rates, White House, U.S. housing crisis, Freddie Mac, real estate market, home loans, 50-year mortgage\nRelated Articles\nU.S. mortgage rates dip to 6.27%, nearing low for 2025\nU.S. home sales fall as mortgage rates, prices hit highs\nJanuary home sales fall 4.9% amid rising rates, prices\nHome sales down 5% throughout metro, state\nFannie Mae housing data leak sparks scrutiny of Trump housing chief\nShare this!\nRelated ContentJO Companies eyes new affordable housing in Brooklyn ParkJO Companies is planning up to 160 affordable units on Brooklyn Boulevard in Brooklyn Park, seeking public fun[...]November 24, 2025Wisconsin bill could make way for sprinklers in older housingA new Wisconsin bill would let local governments mandate sprinklers and fire-prevention upgrades in older hous[...]November 24, 2025Alaska Native villages weight costly relocation optionsStorms, erosion and thawing permafrost are putting Alaska Native villages at risk as communities weigh costly [...]November 24, 2025Supply chain delays, rising prices threaten electricity gridTransformer, circuit breaker, and cable shortages threaten U.S. grid reliability as demand surges from AI, ele[...]November 24, 2025Endeavor plans redevelopment at former Totino’s siteEndeavor Development plans to replace a Fridley bakery with a 250,000-square-foot speculative warehouse, pendi[...]November 21, 2025Q&A: Kim Hofstede steps in as president of Founders PropertiesNew Founders Properties president Kim Hofstede discusses her career path, industrial real estate strategy, mar[...]November 21, 2025\nFinance & Commerce Daily Newsletter\n\nBy signing up you agree to our\nPrivacy Policy\nUpcoming business events\nSee the full list of events here\nEditor’s Picks\nJO Companies eyes new affordable housing in Brooklyn Park\n11/24/2025\nEndeavor plans redevelopment at former Totino’s site\n11/21/2025\nQ&A: Kim Hofstede steps in as president of Founders Properties\n11/21/2025\nMakado buys two Richfield apartment properties\n11/20/2025\nMinnesota groups fight HUD cuts to supportive housing\n11/20/2025\nNews\nEden Prairie flex industrial building sells for $14 million\nA 93K-square-foot flex industrial building in Eden Prairie’s Golden Triangle has sold for $14M as [...]\nJO Companies eyes new affordable housing in Brooklyn Park\nJO Companies is planning up to 160 affordable units on Brooklyn Boulevard in Brooklyn Park, seeking [...]\nWisconsin bill could make way for sprinklers in older housing\nA new Wisconsin bill would let local governments mandate sprinklers and fire-prevention upgrades in [...]\nAlaska Native villages weight costly relocation options\nStorms, erosion and thawing permafrost are putting Alaska Native villages at risk as communities wei[...]\nIPO market stalls as shutdown and investor caution rise\nA government shutdown, SEC backlog and investor caution have slowed IPOs, sending recent debuts lowe[...]\nSupply chain delays, rising prices threaten electricity grid\nTransformer, circuit breaker, and cable shortages threaten U.S. grid reliability as demand surges fr[...]\nBattery limits, safety issues pose challenges to flying taxis\nChina’s low-altitude economy is booming as drones and eVTOL flying taxis expand, though battery li[...]\nUN climate deal boosts funding but skips fossil fuel cuts\nCOP30 ends with a funding boost for climate adaptation but no pledge to phase out fossil fuels, prom[...]\nEndeavor plans redevelopment at former Totino’s site\nEndeavor Development plans to replace a Fridley bakery with a 250,000-square-foot speculative wareho[...]\nJust Sold: North Lakes uses apartment sale for new project\nNorth Lakes Property Management sells four Minnesota apartments to three buyers to help finance a ne[...]\nSpecial Publications\nFinance & Commerce’s Top Women in Finance 2025 profiles\n11/14/2025\nRising Young Professionals honorees announced\n10/14/2025\nFinance & Commerce announces Minnesota Icon honorees\n10/14/2025\nIn the Lead: Women-Owned Businesses 2025\n9/30/2025\nBeyond The Skyline Podcast\nBeyond the Skyline is a podcast and video interview about economic development, real estate and construction in Minnesota.\nListen here\nNews\nEvents\nWebinars\nPodcast\nPublic Notices\nAbout\nFAQ\n\nSubmit a public notice\nPress Releases\nProfessional Announcements\nBTM Business Connect\nBehind the Deal\nContributor Content\nAdvertising\nABOUT\nFinance & Commerce provides news, analysis and commentary on Minnesota business.

Vásquez)\nSan Francisco pushes bold housing plan to tackle affordability crisis\nThe Associated Press//October 30, 2025//\nListen to this article\nThe Blueprint\nMayor Daniel Lurie proposes denser housing to ease San Francisco‘s affordability crisis.\nThe plan would allow taller buildings citywide, including historic areas.\nCritics fear displacement and loss of neighborhood character.\nThe state is pressuring San Francisco to approve 36,000 new homes by 2031.\nSAN FRANCISCO — San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie is trying to get more homes built for people like Liam Murphy: a fifth-generation city kid who found himself repeatedly outbid for tiny two-bedroom houses that wound up selling for $1.6 million.\nMurphy, 39, now lives about an hour’s drive away from his job as a San Francisco firefighter. He says it’s too late for his family to move back, but he hopes others can stay in a city where the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom is $3,500.\n“That would just make for a better city overall,” said Murphy, “and the reason is because city kids just grow up being exposed to more. They’re exposed to all the cultures of San Francisco, which makes a more well-rounded person.”\nTiny, colorful San Francisco — just seven miles squared — embraces its image as a city that welcomes all. But its inability to build more housing has made it one of the world’s toughest places to find a home, risking the diversity it prides itself on.\nEpithets are hurled at the mayor\nLurie hopes to change that, with a plan to allow for denser and taller buildings throughout much of the city, including the westside Sunset neighborhood of single-family homes and the tourist friendly Haight-Ashbury, which is studded with classic Victorian and Edwardian homes.\nThe issue has roiled the city, and threats of recall loom over San Francisco supervisors who go along with Lurie. At a recent housing rally, the mayor who won a rare reprieve from President Donald Trump’s threats to send in federal forces struggled to be heard over angry chants of “shame!” and “liar.”\nProtesters demanded the city invest in 100% below-market rate housing and accused him of being a gentrifier and a Republican.\n“I truly believe that this has San Franciscans’ best interests at heart. Are some people going to be fearful? Absolutely. I get it. Change is scary,” said Lurie, who is a centrist Democrat. “But the status quo is not working. There’s an affordability crisis right now.”\nDemocrats vs. Democrats\nThe city’s estimated 830,000 residents are passionate over both land use and equity. Housing projects have died as pressure to create more affordable units made potential developments unprofitable. Residents also want their stunning views.\nBut San Francisco is under pressure from the state to adopt a new zoning plan allowing for 36,000 more homes by 2031 — or else the state will decide what gets built where — and the mayor likely has the votes to pass his “Family Zoning Plan.”\nSupporters say it’s a matter of supply and demand, and that more homes will bring down the overall cost of housing.\nCritics say such trickle-down economics will not work in a city like San Francisco, which is in such global demand that some foreign investors buy properties sight-unseen. They say developers will only build luxury housing that’s too costly for most workers, while displacing tenants and destroying the character of entire neighborhoods.\n“There’s a herd of elephants in the room that no one will address,” says Eric Jaye, a Democratic political consultant who opposes the plan.\nA city ‘for people who didn’t love cities’\nMuch of the housing push has come from Democrats, including a former city mayor, Gov. Gavin Newsom, who signed into law a proposal by San Francisco state Sen. Scott Wiener to build more homes near transit.\nThe city has made enormous strides in recent years, with whole districts of tall condo buildings cropping up around downtown, says Rafael Mandelman, president of the Board of Supervisors. But he acknowledges that people come to San Francisco for its more intimate neighborhoods and access to green space.\n“San Francisco, historically, was the city for people who didn’t love cities,” Mandelman said.\nKatherine Roberts, 72, initially welcomed construction of an affordable housing complex near the three-story Edwardian she labored to buy in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood two decades ago.\nBut at 160 units and eight stories high, the massive building has shattered her peace of mind, dominating her view.\n“I’m looking out and it’s like I’m living in East Germany. How can you build something this inappropriate in a historic neighborhood like the Haight-Ashbury?” Roberts said. “What about all the people who already live here? What are we supposed to do?”\nProposal calls for denser homes\nFor the most part, the new zoning plan allows for more housing to be packed into the space of a single-family home — say a duplex with a studio — without exceeding the city’s height limit of roughly four stories for such properties. At least 15% of new housing must be below-market rate.\nBuildings on neighborhood commercial corridors could double to eight stories. Busier thoroughfares could see high-rises of 10 stories and more, and in a few spots, on Van Ness Avenue, heights could hit 650 feet, rivaling some downtown skyscrapers.\nPassage of Lurie’s proposal won’t necessarily lead to more homes in a city with high labor and construction costs and “notoriously complex and cumbersome” approval processes, as the state said in a scathing 2023 review.\nAnd so city dwellers make do with overcrowded — and sometimes awkward — living situations.\nLaura Foote, executive director of “yes in my backyard” YIMBY Action, wound up living with the man who is now her husband — and the woman he was divorcing — in a one-bedroom apartment for about six months, until his ex could find another rental.\n“We didn’t kill each other,” Foote said, “but it went on longer than it would have in a well-functioning housing market.”\nMayor’s plan is likely to pass\nSupervisors are still negotiating amendments to the zoning plan, which could be voted out of committee on Monday for consideration by the full board. Some supervisors want to exempt historic properties, or all buildings currently used for housing. The mayor agreed to exempt buildings with at least three rent-controlled units.\nThe compromise was a major relief for Phyllis Nabhan, 78, who lives in the Richmond neighborhood, between the Golden Gate Bridge and Golden Gate Park. She fears becoming homeless if a developer scoops up the property she’s called home for 47 years, starting with a rent of just $350 a month.\nBut Nabhan still objects to the proposal. She says it would ruin her neighborhood’s “cozy and wonderful” feel, and blames the state for forcing the city to change.\n“I think that this mayor is trying,” she said. “It’s a horrible job, I wouldn’t want to be mayor.”\nTags:\ndevelopment, California housing crisis, housing plan, Daniel Lurie, Real Estate, YIMBY, San Francisco, Gavin Newsom, zoning, affordable housing\nRelated Articles\nWellington buys air rights for rentals over Native American clinic\nSt. Paul tackles rezoning for Hamm’s site redevelopment\nRochester buys $2.7M site for new fire station plan\nReport shows economic distress puts affordable homes at risk\nIron District development plan includes soccer stadium\nShare this!\nRelated ContentJO Companies eyes new affordable housing in Brooklyn ParkJO Companies is planning up to 160 affordable units on Brooklyn Boulevard in Brooklyn Park, seeking public fun[...]November 24, 2025Wisconsin bill could make way for sprinklers in older housingA new Wisconsin bill would let local governments mandate sprinklers and fire-prevention upgrades in older hous[...]November 24, 2025Alaska Native villages weight costly relocation optionsStorms, erosion and thawing permafrost are putting Alaska Native villages at risk as communities weigh costly [...]November 24, 2025Supply chain delays, rising prices threaten electricity gridTransformer, circuit breaker, and cable shortages threaten U.S. grid reliability as demand surges from AI, ele[...]November 24, 2025Endeavor plans redevelopment at former Totino’s siteEndeavor Development plans to replace a Fridley bakery with a 250,000-square-foot speculative warehouse, pendi[...]November 21, 2025Q&A: Kim Hofstede steps in as president of Founders PropertiesNew Founders Properties president Kim Hofstede discusses her career path, industrial real estate strategy, mar[...]November 21, 2025\nFinance & Commerce Daily Newsletter\n\nBy signing up you agree to our\nPrivacy Policy\nUpcoming business events\nSee the full list of events here\nEditor’s Picks\nJO Companies eyes new affordable housing in Brooklyn Park\n11/24/2025\nEndeavor plans redevelopment at former Totino’s site\n11/21/2025\nQ&A: Kim Hofstede steps in as president of Founders Properties\n11/21/2025\nMakado buys two Richfield apartment properties\n11/20/2025\nMinnesota groups fight HUD cuts to supportive housing\n11/20/2025\nNews\nEden Prairie flex industrial building sells for $14 million\nA 93K-square-foot flex industrial building in Eden Prairie’s Golden Triangle has sold for $14M as [...]\nJO Companies eyes new affordable housing in Brooklyn Park\nJO Companies is planning up to 160 affordable units on Brooklyn Boulevard in Brooklyn Park, seeking [...]\nWisconsin bill could make way for sprinklers in older housing\nA new Wisconsin bill would let local governments mandate sprinklers and fire-prevention upgrades in [...]\nAlaska Native villages weight costly relocation options\nStorms, erosion and thawing permafrost are putting Alaska Native villages at risk as communities wei[...]\nIPO market stalls as shutdown and investor caution rise\nA government shutdown, SEC backlog and investor caution have slowed IPOs, sending recent debuts lowe[...]\nSupply chain delays, rising prices threaten electricity grid\nTransformer, circuit breaker, and cable shortages threaten U.S. grid reliability as demand surges fr[...]\nBattery limits, safety issues pose challenges to flying taxis\nChina’s low-altitude economy is booming as drones and eVTOL flying taxis expand, though battery li[...]\nUN climate deal boosts funding but skips fossil fuel cuts\nCOP30 ends with a funding boost for climate adaptation but no pledge to phase out fossil fuels, prom[...]\nEndeavor plans redevelopment at former Totino’s site\nEndeavor Development plans to replace a Fridley bakery with a 250,000-square-foot speculative wareho[...]\nJust Sold: North Lakes uses apartment sale for new project\nNorth Lakes Property Management sells four Minnesota apartments to three buyers to help finance a ne[...]\nSpecial Publications\nFinance & Commerce’s Top Women in Finance 2025 profiles\n11/14/2025\nRising Young Professionals honorees announced\n10/14/2025\nFinance & Commerce announces Minnesota Icon honorees\n10/14/2025\nIn the Lead: Women-Owned Businesses 2025\n9/30/2025\nBeyond The Skyline Podcast\nBeyond the Skyline is a podcast and video interview about economic development, real estate and construction in Minnesota.\nListen here\nNews\nEvents\nWebinars\nPodcast\nPublic Notices\nAbout\nFAQ\n\nSubmit a public notice\nPress Releases\nProfessional Announcements\nBTM Business Connect\nBehind the Deal\nContributor Content\nAdvertising\nABOUT\nFinance & Commerce provides news, analysis and commentary on Minnesota business.

Cultural Anthropologist on Today's Affordability and Access\n28-Oct-2025 8:00 AM EDT,\nby Wake Forest University\n♡\nCredit: ©2025 Wake Forest University\nDownload\nCredit: Sherri Lawson Clark\nPrevious\nNext\nNewswise — Is America currently in a housing crisis? Wake Forest University's Sherri Lawson Clark says individuals at all economic levels—from homeless populations to middle-income homeowners are struggling with affordability.A contributor to the 2020 national report\xa0Displaced in America, Clark’s research examines the intersections of housing policy with health and welfare policies. She is developing a new housing stability measure for use throughout the U.S. in addressing housing affordability and access.Is America facing a housing crisis?Yes. As a cultural anthropologist, I am interested in the ways in which the housing crisis is experienced at the individual level. A homeless person is experiencing a housing crisis as is the middle-income homeowner whose housing costs have risen above their income. Right now, the question is not necessarily are we in a housing crisis, but are we in a place where we are likely to see the next Great Recession. I think we’re at a place where we need to pay attention.How does this moment compare to the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis that led to the Great Recession?In similar ways, the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis\xa0did not\xa0begin in 2007; it began in the mid-1990s – taking almost a decade before the financial crisis of 2008. Today, many Americans find themselves unable to afford housing. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the average homeowner or renter should spend no more than 30% of their monthly income on housing. My research shows that individuals are spending up to half of their monthly income on housing costs. This means there is little left over in their budgets for other necessities. According to the National Housing Conference, a non-profit organization dedicated to affordable housing, two issues define America’s new housing crisis: 1) skyrocketing housing costs and 2) the low rate of black homeownership, which is lower today than it was when segregation was legal.What does your research show?My current research study will shed light on the decision-making processes of homeowners and examine housing accessibility in one of East Winston-Salem, North Carolina’s high-poverty census tracts. I expect the findings will greatly aid in a newly created Housing Stability measure for use throughout the U.S. (and beyond) in addressing housing affordability and access.How do housing affordability challenges differ between urban centers, suburbs and rural areas?Available housing differs across urban areas with multi-family housing, suburban areas with single-family homes, and rural areas with more manufactured housing and single-family housing. However, all these areas face housing affordability concerns, which are projected to get worse with the current changes happening at the federal level.Who’s most at risk and what can be done?The most vulnerable across all areas are being displaced. Now is the time to think outside the box to develop alternatives to the traditional housing models. For example, limited equity cooperatives provide long-term affordability to residents who own shares in a development. Reducing zoning restrictions allows for more multi-family and smaller homes to be built on land zoned for single-family homes.Biography :Sherri Lawson Clark is an associate professor in the Department of Anthropology at Wake Forest University, where she has taught since 2009. An applied cultural anthropologist, she has conducted ethnographic fieldwork for more than 30 years with low-income urban and rural African American, Latino and white families across the U.S.\xa0Clark’s research focuses on housing instability among poor families and examines the intersections of housing policy with health and welfare policies, marriage initiatives, migration, and the effects of residential mobility on the well-being of poor children and families.\xa0At Wake Forest, Clark teaches courses in cultural anthropology and social stratification in America and helps students deconstruct and comprehend conceptual arguments by applying them in real life contexts.She is co-author of “Poverty Law and Advocacy in America” and a contributing editor to “Contemporary African American Families: Achievements, Challenges, and Empowerment Strategies in the Twenty-First Century.”###\xa0About Wake Forest UniversityWake Forest University’s motto, Pro Humanitate, reflects a commitment to academic excellence and to using ideas, knowledge and talents on behalf of humanity.

Wes Moore announced the launch of the Maryland Community Investment Venture Fund to assist small business owners on Wednesday, June 4, 2025. (Governor\'s Office)     \nMD housing order aims to boost affordable housing, cut barriers  \n\nCapital News Service//September 26, 2025//      \n\n Listen to this article  \n\n Key takeaways \n \nGov. Wes Moore signed Housing Starts Here executive order. \nMaryland faces a 96,000-unit housing deficit statewide. \nInitiative targets faster housing permits and state land use. \nPlan promotes transit-oriented development to cut costs.  \n  \nGov. Wes Moore signed an executive order on Sept. 3 aimed at tackling Maryland’s escalating housing affordability crisis. The Housing Starts Here initiative seeks to expedite housing development, reduce production delays and make home ownership more accessible across the state. \nAccording to the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), the state faces a deficit of around 96,000 housing units – a gap that has been widening over recent years.\n\nThe 2025 Maryland Housing Needs Assessment, an analysis of Maryland’s housing gap conducted by DHCD and The National Center for Smart Growth, reveals significant disparities in housing availability across the state. Counties like Montgomery and Howard have median home prices exceeding $600,000, making homeownership unattainable for low and middle income residents. \nConversely, areas such as Allegany and Wicomico counties report median home prices below $200,000, which indicates regional inconsistencies in the Maryland housing market. \nThe executive order will broadly target each county in Maryland in order to create more housing development throughout the state.\n\n“[The executive order] says that everybody has a piece of the housing crisis, and everybody deserves for their local and state governments to be working in concert to solve that crisis,” DHCD Secretary Jake Day said. \nIn more than half of Maryland counties, renters are spending more than one-third of their annual income on housing costs, which is considered unaffordable by federal standards. \nWhile Maryland’s median income is 28% higher than the national median, the state’s median home price is 35% higher, highlighting the disproportionate cost of housing. \n“How we got here is really the post-2008 financial crisis. It was real-estate driven… that had to do with risks that the financial industry took at the time,” Secretary Day said. “It led to a collapse in the economy, in residential home values and more. The over-correction of the market meant we stopped building houses at a pace that matched population growth.” \nThe Housing Starts Here Executive Order directs state agencies to identify underutilized state-owned properties suitable for transit-oriented development, aiming to increase housing density in areas with existing infrastructure. \nTransit-oriented development is a strategy that promotes dense, mixed-use communities around transit to help increase ridership and the use of public transportation. \n“There are a lot of benefits to it… we want to develop state-owned land for transit-oriented development, since state-owned land is not currently taxable. There’s no revenue generation for the states or local jurisdictions. It also provides an opportunity for Marylanders to live closer to transit and use it more,” Maryland Department of Transportation’s Chief of Real Estate and Transit-Oriented Development, David Zaidain, said. \nAccording to Zaidain, transportation is the second biggest household budget item behind housing. It costs roughly $600 a month for Marylanders to own a car, which is pushing the state towards more transit usage. \nZaidain also noted the climate change benefits that come with transit-oriented development. \nThe executive order directs the state to speed up timelines for housing permits and establish a state housing ombudsman, or overseer, to help projects move forward. \nThe legislation comes on the heels of a 2024 legislative package that made housing more affordable and accessible for Marylanders struggling with construction barriers, along with creating the Office of Tenant and Landlord Affairs. \nThe Housing Starts Here order also directs agencies to track housing production progress annually, coordinate with local governments to address regional shortages and ensure accountability across jurisdictions. \nBy centralizing oversight and removing barriers, the administration aims to close the housing deficit and expand affordable options for Marylanders in the years ahead. \n“When regulatory processes add cost, that cost has to be recouped – either with higher rents or a higher sales price. So, the more regulatory burden we place, the more likely it is that we’re just producing expensive [places] for people to live,” Secretary Day said. “By cutting time and money out of the process, by streamlining it, we can make it easier to get to the finish line.” \n\nTags: Development, housing, affordable housing, Wes Moore, Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development, Jake Day, Real Estate, Transportation, maryland economy, public transportation \n\nRelated Articles \n \nMoore, Metro select firm for North Bethesda redevelopment \nState Center redevelopment enters new phase as search for consultants begins \nMoore signs order aimed at expanding affordable housing: ‘We need to move faster’ \nMD announces $36.8M toward affordable housing initiative \nBaltimore neighborhood first to receive UPLIFT funds for quality affordable housing    \n\nShare this! \n\nRelated Content\n\nMD-based Sinclair submits bid to buy out E.W.

City Councilor Sharon Durkan for District 8 is working with other councilors on PLAN: Downtown to bring more affordable housing to the area. (ANNIKA MORRIS) \nThe average rent in Boston for a one-bedroom apartment is $3,452 a month, compared to the national average of $1,631 a month, according to Apartments.com The price of an average single-family home in Massachusetts increased 74% from 2016 to 2024, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. \n“The cost of housing is rising in our neighborhoods,” said City Councilor Sharon Durkan, who represents district 8, which includes Boston University. “It’s something that I hear from residents every day at my office hours, residents are being priced out.” \n12% of Boston voters believe housing affordability is the most important issue facing the United States, according to Emerson College polling. \nDurkan said the council has been taking “bold steps” to allow for the development of more housing.  \nSome of the steps Durkan emphasized included amending the zoning code to make housing an allowed use in the Bullfinch Triangle, an area in Boston nestled between the West and North Ends, as well as the PLAN: Downtown initiative to bring more affordable housing to the Downtown area. \nDurkan’s platform supports planning for “abundance” in Boston housing. \n“[Abundance is] about saying yes to new people moving into the city,” Durkan said. “It’s about saying yes to new neighbors, and yes to making sure that our communities and the people that want to live there can stay there.”  \nCity Councilor Ed Flynn said the city needs to increase the supply of affordable housing units to help address the housing crisis. \n“I’ve been a strong advocate for increasing affordable housing, veteran’s housing [and] family-size units to help working families remain in the city,” Flynn said. \nOther initiatives to allow for more housing include At-Large City Councilor Henry Santana’s proposed expansion of triple decker housing. Current zoning laws limit many buildings to two and a half stories, preventing the construction of triple-deckers. \nAs another strategy to address the housing affordability crisis, Santana, along with City Councilors Benjamin Weber and Enrique Pepén, none of whom decided to comment, sponsored a resolution in support of a rent control measure on the 2026 ballot. The initiative, filed by Homes For All Massachusetts, would reverse the statewide ban on rent control passed in 1994. \nTamara Small, CEO of NAIOP Massachusetts, an association representing the interests of the real estate industry, said rent control measures would be detrimental to the development of more housing statewide. \n“We are already getting calls from investors all over the world who have heard about this proposal, and they have said if rent control is adopted, then it’s really going to kill housing production in Massachusetts,” Small said.  \nCity Councilor Brian Worrell, in a city council meeting Oct. 29, proposed a plan to increase taxes on large and luxury apartment buildings and decrease tax bills for small landlords and average homeowners. \n“Homeowners and small landlords are carrying a heavier load while larger apartment owners often pay less taxes per unit,” Worrell said in the hearing. \nDurkan said she opposes Worrell’s proposal, calling it a “gut-punch at the wrong moment” for housing development. \n“[The proposal] really places undue burden on dense areas,” Durkan said, “If we’re trying to encourage housing production and density in the city of Boston … it really doesn’t fit with the city’s goals at the moment.” \nSmall also disagreed with Worell’s proposal, and said expenses would get pushed on tenants and would “dramatically disincentivize any type of investment in Boston housing development.” \nHilary Pizer, director of Organizing and Policy at the Massachusetts Affordable Homeownership Alliance, wrote in support of Worrell’s policy in a statement to the Daily Free Press.  \n“MAHA strongly supports this proposal that offers property tax relief to homeowners being squeezed by rising costs,” Pizer wrote. “When you own the home you live in, it’s your shelter, and eventually your nest egg. It should be taxed at the lower residential rate.”    \n\n   View Story Comments  \n\n 0    Like This Story   \n \n    Share on Facebook   \n \n    Share on X   \n \n    Email this Story   \n \n    Print this Story   \n\n Leave a Comment  \n Tags:  \n\naffordable housing\nBoston City Council\nBoston municipal elections\ncity councilor benjamin weber\nCity Councilor Brian Worrell\nCity Councilor Enrique Pepén\nCity Councilor Henry Santana\nCity Councilor Sharon Durkan\nMassachusetts Affordable Homeownership Alliance\nnaiop\nrent control  \n\nDonate to The Daily Free Press  \n \nYour donation will support the student journalists of Boston University.

Francesca Hong’s run for governor. Her platform advocates for affordable housing, a $23 minimum wage by 2030, no-cost child and health care and full funding for the Wisconsin public schooling system.  \n\nBennett served on the Madison Common Council for two terms from April 2021 to April 2025.  \nShe joins an open Democratic primary where the party has had an unbroken hold on the 76th assembly district seat since 2013. She’s competing against a current Common Council member vying for the seat— Dina Nina Martinez-Rutherford. \nWhile her political experience has shaped her understanding of government, Bennett’s personal experiences have played an equally significant role in motivating her to serve. Bennett’s advocacy for cheaper medical care started with medical debt her family experienced as she finished her degree in 2022 from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  \nHer father had fallen into cardiac arrest with a 6% chance of survival, it was made clear that it would take a miracle for Bennett's father to pull through. Thankfully, through the tireless efforts of medical staff, he did. However, while her father may have won a large battle with his health, there existed another battle entirely: the medical bill.  \nWith the costs totaling some $500,000 and an eviction looming on the horizon, Bennett saw firsthand the significant impact the state’s laws had on the well-being of its people.  \nThe experience not only motivated her to become an alder twice and pass local ordinances that aligned with her goals in Madison, but also inspired her to announce her current campaign for state assembly, where Bennett could extend her influence throughout Wisconsin. \n\n“I really saw the personal impact of how our state laws are really prohibitive on the general public, and there's only so much you can do as an alder when the state has hamstrung every single thing that we could do to help people,” Bennett told The Daily Cardinal. \nBennett said students could be one of the  largest populations to benefit from her policies, as she aims to improve the financial and housing prospects of being a college student in Wisconsin, especially at UW-Madison. \nFully funding the Wisconsin public education system ultimately depends on how dollars are earned and allocated within the state assembly. To increase earnings, Bennett  believes in revisiting previous avenues, such as taxing income rather than just property taxes. Other areas of investment, such as spending on incarceration, could also be significantly reduced to reinvest in public schools. \nBennett is also in support of the Wisconsin Tuition Promise, a ‘last dollar’ tuition program the University of Wisconsin System instituted in 2023, paused and reinstituted in 2025 that covers any remaining costs of attendance for those whose families earn under the median Wisconsin income.  \n \n  Enjoy what you're reading? Get content from The Daily Cardinal delivered to your inbox \n \n Email \n\nIn the interest of covering remaining fees following students' financial aid, Bennett said the ‘last dollar’ program would minimize students’ need to take out loans they cannot afford, while encouraging Wisconsin resident enrollment in higher education. \nBennett also acknowledged the current housing crisis UW-Madison students experience.  \nShe plans to combat the issue by supporting UW-Madison’s  request for funding to construct additional residence halls, which would ideally decrease the cost of living for students. “Yes, [it would be] a few million dollars, but that in comparison is a drop in the bucket… to other priorities or issue areas,” Bennett said. \nFor those living off campus, or simply non-students residing in Madison, Bennett has continually advocated for cooperative housing and a tenant bill of rights.  \nHer proposal would include granting greater negotiating power to tenants, preventing properties under the affordability requirement from expiring, conducting routine annual inspections to maintain health standards and requiring landlords to have reasonable grounds for evictions. \nWhile Bennett believes these solutions would be effective in managing the housing crisis in Madison, she acknowledges the need to address the root of the issue. \n“But truly, when the rubber hits the road, it's about creating affordability across the city and across the state. We just need to build more homes. Wisconsin is in a shortage of 200,000 affordable homes, and we currently don't have a plan to get there.” \nHowever, Bennett foresees an obstacle. She criticized Democrats, saying her own party lacks a clear consensus on issues relating to equal rights for women, transgender people and people of color.  \n“I think that we need to have real come-to-Jesus moments within our party, and from the things that I'm hearing from residents and students and young people in Madison, it’s that we're tired of our elected leaders kind of selling us out,” Bennett said. “I think that there is a real issue of where our leaders, in the aura of trying to compromise, have become compromised themselves.” \nReflecting on her time as a student activist at UW-Madison and her involvement in student government through the Associated Students of Madison, Bennett said her student experience shaped her desire to become the change she wanted to see in her party. \nThis is why Bennett wants to reinstate the right to shared governance. ASM does not possess nearly as much power as it once did, Bennett explained, with much of its previous power having been relegated to the chancellor.  \nBennett said her journey from student activist to city alder to state assembly candidate underscores a commitment to turning personal struggle into public action.  \n“You deserve a representative who has been in your shoes and fought for your needs. I will be that representative,” she said. \nParty primary election will take place on Aug. 11, with the Democratic candidate likely to win the seat on Nov. 3, 2026 in the heavily-Democratic district.

GRACE CHEN / THE DAILY PENNSYLVANIAN\nBy COSTA GAY-AFENDULIS\nNov. 3, 2025\n\nPenn’s Architecture department hosted a panel at the Weitzman School of Design to discuss the practice of adaptively converting vacant office buildings into residential units in cities.\n\nThe Oct. 29 panel included six experts in the field with backgrounds in architecture, journalism, and finance who spoke about the benefits and considerations of applying adaptive reuse on a large scale. This practice has gained traction in recent years as a way to bring life back to central business districts following a shift to remote work that has emptied out many American downtowns and the rapidly growing demand for housing.\xa0\n\nWeitzman associate professor of practice Hina Jamelle, who also serves as the school’s urban housing director, organized the event. During the panel, she explained that there has been “a renewed attention on adaptive reuse, especially the conversion of commercial buildings into housing.”\n\nJamelle added that the event’s title, “Under Pressure”, refers to “a call for action in a timely and efficient way, because [they] realize that pressure has come to bear on certain aspects of the city.” She emphasized that the housing crisis is relevant to Penn students because “the chances are very high” that many of them are “going to be moving to an urban center” upon graduation.\n\n“Everyone needs a place to live,” she said. “We would not want cities to just be for sort of a certain asset class. You really want a city to have that engaging vibrancy of younger people coming in, new ideas coming in, and people being able to thrive.”\xa0\n\nWeitzman city and regional planning professor Vincent Reina, who worked as an urban housing policy advisor in the Biden-Harris administration, sat on the panel. He emphasized a need for “actual affordable units,” given that there is an estimated “shortage of 65,000 affordable, available housing units” in the city.\xa0\n\n“If you look at the housing stock in Philadelphia, we actually have enough housing for most households,” he said during the event. “We just don’t have enough housing for the very poor households.”\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Pennsylvanian, Reina said that solving these issues in the city “requires a real and consistent commitment from the city to address the housing needs, but particularly for the most vulnerable residents”.\xa0\n\nReina has prior experience working with students on public housing projects in New York City, which he said “spurred” him to think about “the critical role that housing plays” in helping residents feel that they are “a part of the community.”\n\nReina told the DP that his team helped develop PHL Housing Plus, a project to rehabilitate homes for affordability, and other Philadelphia initiatives such as Rebuilding Together.\xa0\n\nArchitecture student Ryan Newbling emphasized the importance of having urban “space that really connects and drives a community, versus just having repetitive residential units,” in an interview with the DP.\n\nNewbling added that the event was also integrated into the graduate architecture program. Students had their own work “on display,” which focused on “bringing life back to urban spaces.”\n\nWall Street Journal reporter and panelist Peter Grant emphasized the historical significance of the broad evacuation of office space and why reuse is worth the investment. According to Grant, unlike downturns in office use in the late 1990s and late 2010s that ended up rebounding, “the downturn now is not cyclical, it’s structural … this is here to stay.”\n\nHowever, the panelists also discussed the complications and costs of the process of adaptive reuse. Buildings that are constructed to serve as office spaces often face fewer structural requirements than residential units — such as for included window spaces — and need expensive renovations. Grant discussed how economic factors still aren’t fully allowing this process to be implemented on a large scale everywhere.\xa0\n\n“There’s one city where you do have the necessary ingredients, and that’s New York,” Grant said during the event. “You have some Magic Mountain out there in New York that’s producing people who are making enough money to afford $4,000 a month rents — that’s not happening in a lot of these other markets.”\n\nThe panelists provided examples of proposed and completed reuse projects in a wide range of cities, like Chicago, New York, Baton Rouge, La., and Providence, R.I.\n\nReina concluded that adaptive reuse is “a really important piece” of solving the housing crisis.\xa0\n\n“Can you actually solve our housing supply problems with these conversions? I think no,” Reina said. “But you add a really important piece to our puzzle — to our many tools that we need to actually address our housing supply needs and community issues.”\n\nThe Daily Pennsylvanian is an independent, student-run newspaper.

Greater recognition of PACE services as an operational differentiator began in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic as providers worked to extend services and connect with older adults outside their communities.\nSenior living providers including Immanuel, EveryAge and Health Dimensions Group (HDG) believe PACE services could be the “missing link” between clinical integration and social support to improve quality of life for older adults outside traditional senior living settings. Currently, HDG is a PACE consulting organization along with serving as a National PACE Association Technical Assistance Center.\n“The PACE center is where people thrive,” said Immanuel CEO Eric Gurley. “They can socialize, be engaged and do activities and it’s important that we remember this forgotten population by and large.”\nThis comes as the National PACE Association reported rapid growth in 2024 when 24 new PACE programs opened, triple the historical annual average, according to National PACE Association CEO Shawn Bloom.\n“What we’re seeing is unprecedented interest in PACE, particularly among organizations that want to sponsor PACE as a service delivery model in their communities,” Bloom told SHN.\nEveryAge, a North Carolina-based nonprofit, has seen more seniors who can’t afford private-pay options turn to PACE to access comprehensive services while remaining in their communities.\nOver 11.5 million older Americans aged 75 and up will be unable to afford assisted living in the coming decade, according to the “Forgotten Middle” affordability study by NORC at the University of Chicago.\nIn 2025, seven new PACE programs have opened, with more “on the cusp” of opening soon, Bloom added. But challenges remain in growing PACE partnerships in senior living due to a complex mix of issues, including an uneven patchwork of state-specific regulations, prohibitive startup costs and eligibility factors that make adoption tougher.\nBenefits of PACE\nPACE organizations establish networks of providers to deliver a full continuum of services that meet participants’ healthcare needs. When participants live in or require assisted living care, the PACE organization contracts with an assisted living facility to provide a comprehensive package of services. As part of the partnership, PACE is responsible for payment of all required services in assisted living, Bloom said.\nOmaha, Nebraska-based nonprofit senior living provider Immanuel uses its PACE partnership to “close the clinical gap” and address the clinical, emotional and social needs of residents under a unified model, according to CEO Eric Gurley. He describes PACE as a return to “true continuum thinking,” combining person-centered senior living values with clinical expertise.\n“At the time, it was a novel idea,” Gurley said of launching PACE centers. “Now, as we see systems evolving, it’s clear that taking that step back then was truly courageous.”\nStaff often tailor their approach to meet participants’ preferences — for example, building rapport through small daily gestures that help earn trust before providing in-home services, Gurley said.\nEveryAge, based in North Carolina, operates three PACE centers across the Tar Heel State near affordable housing communities to support low-income seniors’ ability to age in place. EveryAge staff lead extensive community outreach efforts by partnering with local organizations to educate and identify eligible seniors, EveryAge Director of Home- and Community-Based Services Thomas Chang told SHN.\n“Our goal in senior living is to provide a variety of environments for home and health that accommodate older adults in different phases of life,” Chang told SHN.\nThese partnerships have reduced unscheduled hospitalizations and emergency department visits while strengthening ties with local communities, he added. Through PACE’s interdisciplinary care model, assisted living operations benefit from coordinated care, clinical planning and risk management, making PACE a strong partner for assisted living providers, according to Health Dimensions Group Senior Vice President of Consulting Services Tom Stitt.\n“It’s the full continuum of services in one package,” Stitt said. “PACE has a proven track record of improving the mental and physical health of participants. Senior living communities will hopefully see this in their residents enrolled in PACE.”\nClose engagement between PACE and assisted living staff at the community level can help identify PACE-eligible participants, bringing additional scale and more resources for programming and engagement opportunities, Chang said. Through ongoing health monitoring and intervention, PACE partnerships have made a positive clinical impact while improving social ties among residents and more introverted, at-home older adults.\nWhat drives PACE expansion\nState regulation changes, affordability pressures and increased demand for community-based services are pushing senior living providers to align with and host PACE programs. At the national level, PACE advocates are working to reintroduce and pass the Duals Act and the Part D Choice Act, which would allow older adults to maintain Part D Medicaid.\n“While there have been significant improvements in the affordability of Part D… it still costs roughly $4,700 a month,” Bloom said. “I don’t know how long most seniors could afford to do that, even though it is far less than institutional care.”\nCo-location of PACE and senior housing can create significant cost efficiencies for the PACE program and provide much needed care coordination for senior living communities and their low-income residents, Stitt said\nTechnology integration also helps capture better data for social group meetings and program attendance, Gurley said, calling it a chance for operations teams from different backgrounds to build relationships and better understand the communities they serve.\nThe future of senior living as a hub for PACE centers\nAs senior living providers expand their high-acuity care models, PACE partnerships could continue to drive clinical and operational innovation as residents delay entry into senior living and present with higher acuity needs.\n“Incorporating PACE programs into our portfolio has diversified the revenue stream and allowed us to see how other models address the needs of seniors,” Chang said.\nIn the future, Gurley believes that PACE services and partners could serve as a gateway for future Medicare Advantage plans on a capitated risk basis to take on greater risk and advance value-based care efforts in senior living.\n“We have the skill set because we’re the provider, not just the insurer,” Gurley added.\nAs care needs become more complex, Bloom envisions a world where PACE centers and senior living operators work more closely to reach new groups of older adults living at home who need valuable programming, social connection and care delivery.\n“The value added by PACE integration is among the most important improvements we can make to an older individual’s ability to live with dignity and independence,” Bloom said.\nShare\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nSend email\nCompanies featured in this article:\nEveryAge, Health Dimensions Group, Immanuel, National PACE Association\nAustin Montgomery\nAustin Montgomery is a reporter for Senior Housing News as part of WTWH Media.

The move comes amid softer labor market conditions and a federal government shutdown that has stalled most economic data releases.“Falling interest rates will help America’s small businesses access the credit they need to capitalize on the strong economic momentum created by President Trump and Congressional Republicans’ pro-growth policies,” Job Creators Network CEO Alfredo Ortiz told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “With inflation tamed, gas prices at their lowest level in years, record stock market highs, and the Big Beautiful Bill’s tax cuts fueling expansion, the economy is well-positioned for continued growth,” Ortiz added. “This rate cut will empower small businesses to expand, hire, invest, and drive America’s economic resurgence to even greater heights.” (RELATED: SCOTT TURNER: At HUD, Homes and Healthcare Financing Are On The Line During Shutdown)\nUS Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks at a news conference at the Federal Reserve headquarters, following the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, on September 17, 2025. (Photo by JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images) The cut comes against a backdrop of weakening jobs data. The most recent available report, for August, showed just\xa0 22,000 jobs added, while Bureau of Labor Statistics revisions revealed 911,000 fewer jobs created over the prior year than previously estimated.\nThe September employment report, typically released in early October, remains unpublished due to the shutdown. The only major data point issued since the impasse began was Friday’s Consumer Price Index, which showed annual inflation rising 3% in September, below forecasts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, speaking on Oct. 14, acknowledged the data vacuum but noted the central bank continues to monitor an array of public and private-sector indicators, stating that the “outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting.” Powell added that while recent economic data have come in stronger than expected, it hasn’t yet translated into renewed hiring strength.\n“You do have a bit of tension between labor market data – we see very low levels of job creation – and yet people are spending,” Powell said. “We are going to have to see how that plays out.” Economists broadly anticipate a third quarter-point cut at the Fed’s December meeting, which would bring the federal funds rate 0.75 percentage points lower by year-end than it stood in January. “Inflation has been surprisingly sticky, but is coming down and will continue to come down. Thus, a series of quarter-point cuts until the funds rate is approaching 3% seems appropriate,” JD Foster, former chief economist at the Office of Management and Budget, told the DCNF. “As the economy appears to remain on pretty solid footing, there’s no real need to move more quickly.” Mortgage rates — which the Fed does not directly control but are strongly influenced by its actions — have already fallen in anticipation. Freddie Mac reported the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6.19% as of Oct. 23, down from 6.5% a year earlier. Yet, further relief to homebuyers may be limited. “Markets are forward-looking and have already priced in the likelihood of additional cuts,” Tobias Peter, co-director at the American Enterprise Institute’s Housing Center, told the DCNF. “Rates have come down quite a bit from a year ago, so another quarter-point move may not shift the needle much.” At around 6%, many existing homeowners remain locked into lower-rate mortgages and are reluctant to sell, constricting supply. Housing affordability has become a key focus for the Trump administration, as only 28% of homes in the market are affordable for the average household, according to Realtor.com. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated in September that the administration may declare a national housing emergency, while President Donald Trump has also floated ideas like eliminating capital gains taxes on home sales. Foster, however, voiced skepticism about such tax changes. “Few home sellers pay capital gains tax because they roll their equity into their next home. And for those few who might face a tax, what happens? The same thing that happens whenever you cut the tax on an asset — the asset price rises,” Foster said. “That’s not making housing more affordable.” Foster argued the most effective lever remains lower interest rates, saying, “Bring down mortgage rates and, over time, local housing markets will return to normal in terms of supply.” Peter said that while many solutions to the affordable housing crisis must come from state and local governments, such as zoning reform, there are also meaningful steps that can be taken at the federal level. For example, he suggested that the Bureau of Land Management could sell land located within one to five miles of existing development. “Over the span of 10 years, we think that could easily add up to a million new housing units,” Peter said. He also urged the administration to use its bully pulpit to promote reforms such as reducing minimum lot sizes, lowering taxes for small-scale developers, and easing restrictions on manufactured homes, measures he said could significantly boost the housing supply.

It wasn’t easy, he said, but it was doable. \nBut the reality of an affordable city with opportunity for all seems to be slipping away. \nLin and his now-wife have raised their two children in the Beacon Hill neighborhood, “but I don’t know how they’re going to afford to live here,” he said. His mother, now 86, recently retired and is planning to move to the city. On a fixed income with limited savings, the rental market is looking tough, he said. \n“We see our city transforming, and not in a good direction on affordability,” said Lin, 48, on a recent morning at The Station coffee shop on Beacon Hill. “It’s not easy to change trajectories, but we do have things that we can do.”\nLin, an assistant attorney at the Seattle city attorney’s office currently on sabbatical, is running for the City Council District 2 seat left open after Tammy Morales stepped down in January, triggering a special election. His challenger is Adonis Ducksworth, communications and policy adviser at the Seattle Department of Transportation. \nDistrict 2 encompasses Beacon Hill, Chinatown International District, Columbia City, Rainier Beach and Seward Park. It is the city’s most racially diverse district and among its most economically mixed.\n \nAdvertising \n\nSources: Esri, Seattle Redistricting Commission (Mark Nowlin / The Seattle Times) \nTackling housing affordability, and the issues surrounding it like homelessness and public safety, are central to Lin’s campaign. To promote a flourishing community, Seattle and Washington state must increase taxes on big businesses and wealthy residents, he said, while reducing the financial burden on working families and low-income households. \nMost of his work at the Seattle city attorney’s office has been with the city’s Office of Housing, where he implemented policies related to affordable housing, new development and anti-displacement. \nHe helped negotiate the transfer of surplus property from Sound Transit and the University of Washington to the city for affordable housing construction in South Seattle, and shepherded the Four Amigos affordable housing project in Columbia City.  \n“I bring that skill set of understanding housing finance, understanding our regulations,” Lin said.  \nHis experience and priorities appear to have resonated — in the Aug. 5 primary, Lin received about 47% of the vote, while his challenger Ducksworth received about 29%. But Lin, whose public service work remains relatively unknown to many, continues to hit the pavement and meet voters.\nMoving to Seattle \nLin grew up in North Carolina and Massachusetts, before moving to Minnesota to attend Macalester College where he met his wife. \n \nAdvertising \n\nShe graduated, but Lin had yet to finish school, having struggled with some mental health challenges. Ready to leave the Midwest, they road tripped across the West Coast before settling in Seattle in the late 1990s.\nHis wife taught reading at Dunlap Elementary as an AmeriCorps tutor, and Lin picked up odd jobs. Renting an apartment in Interbay, Lin completed his credits and graduated, while his wife earned a master’s degree at the University of Washington in 2001.\nThe couple moved to Oakland, Calif., where Lin got a job as a receptionist at a law firm and his wife became a teacher and active member of her union. Lin later joined a San Francisco firm that represented labor groups and championed progressive causes around living wages and voting rights, inspiring him to go to law school.   \n\n“It was just very exciting for me to see attorneys doing this very impactful work,” Lin said. \nThey returned to Seattle, and Lin went on to work as an attorney at Perkins Coie. But in the back of his mind, Lin said, he wanted to do something more community service oriented, a feeling that grew stronger when President Donald Trump was elected in 2016. \nHousing affordability\nLong term, the city needs more dense, walkable neighborhoods with good public transit, Lin said. \n \nAdvertising \n\n“That’s how we’re going to address this multitude of issues around affordability, around climate change, around resilience, around public safety,” Lin said.\nThe city needs to make it easier and cheaper to build all housing types, he said. Seattle’s growth plan should have included more neighborhood centers, he said, and eliminated parking minimums.\nLin said he supports broader renter protections, such as the recently passed statewide cap on annual rent increases. He also wants to increase city dollars to help keep affordable housing developers and nonprofit groups up and running. \n\nMost Read Local Stories \n \n Sea-Tac flights make refueling stops; no timeline to fix pipeline leak   \n South Park residents endure recurring sulfur, ‘rotten egg’ smell   \n Thanksgiving week travel: WA passes to get heaping servings of snow   \n What really led Trump to threaten Seattle’s World Cup   \n Seattle-area Thanksgiving traffic: The best and worst times to drive     \nStephanie Velasco, a city planning educator who’s worked with Lin, said he is adept at navigating complicated issues. She pointed to his work in implementing the city’s “community preference” housing policy, which encourages city-funded housing projects to consider neighborhood ties when selecting occupants.\n“As the lawyer in the room … he could’ve really easily said, ‘No, there’s too much risk,’ ” Velasco said.\nInstead, Lin helped ensure the policy was shielded from the lawsuits other cities saw over similar efforts, but remained an effective tool to promote racial equity, Velasco said. \n\nSponsored  \n\nHomelessness\nFor too long, District 2 has been the primary victim of Seattle’s failure to address homelessness, said Sharon Maeda, a longtime activist in South Seattle and former journalist, referencing Little Saigon and ongoing public safety issues there.  \nMaeda said she’s been disappointed before by candidates, but Lin impressed her with his understanding of what’s working — and what’s not. \n“You can’t do it overnight, and what I appreciate about Eddie the most is he really is a thoughtful thinker, and he knows how to pull pieces together,” she said. \n\nLin does not support the mayor’s effort to increase encampment removals, saying it’s a costly policy that traumatizes and pushes people around while failing to address root causes of homelessness. \nThe city needs to increase its behavioral health services and drug treatment capacity, build more low-barrier shelters and fund more supportive housing, Lin said. \nPublic safety\nOn a recent weekend of doorknocking, Lin came across Ronald Cabang at his childhood home, helping his parents fry lumpia in the garage. When Lin asked Cabang what city officials should prioritize, the answer was quick. \n \nAdvertising \n\nJust last week, Cabang said, someone snatched his mother’s necklace right off her neck as she was gardening. She didn’t report the incident to police.\n“Her English isn’t really good, so they don’t really communicate with police officers,” Cabang said. “They feel like they just have to deal with things but at the same time I can’t do anything either.”\nStories like that are part of why Lin supports hiring more police officers, he said, with a focus on hiring diverse officers who speak different languages. He also wants to beef up youth programs to reduce gun violence and delinquency. \nLin said the city should invest more in its CARE department, the nonemergency police alternative. The Seattle Police Department overall, he said, is in need of greater accountability and civilian oversight. \nProgressive revenue \nLin is a staunch critic of the state’s regressive tax code, which forces the city’s poorest residents to contribute a greater share of their income toward taxes than wealthier neighbors. As a council member, Lin said he would work with state lawmakers to advocate for a state income tax. \nHe would like to see a local capital gains tax or a higher rate for the city’s existing JumpStart tax initiative, a payroll tax on large businesses with high-earning employees intended to fund affordable housing. \n“We’re never going to be able to meet the needs of our community without fixing our upside down tax code,” Lin said. \n\n Alexandra Yoon-Hendricks: 206-464-2246 or ayoonhendricks@seattletimes.com.

It highlights how many homes are needed, what types of housing are being built, and includes benchmarks for both renters and homeowners.It also features demographic insights, including household income, household size, and preferences for housing types like apartments, condos, townhomes, or single-family homes.Reno City Manager Jackie Bryant and Housing Manager Elaine Wiseman explain the tool’s features in a new informational video available on the City’s website and social media pages.“We’re excited to launch this new housing dashboard, which gives our team a clearer, more accurate picture of Reno’s housing market across all income levels and the gaps that exist,” said Bryant. “This dashboard represents a significant step forward in the City’s ongoing commitment to working with our partners to expand housing opportunities for the Biggest Little City.”Since 2016, home prices in Reno have increased by 93 percent. According to the dashboard, at least 15,000 new homes are needed over the next 10 years, including 9,000 units considered affordable for households earning below 80 percent of the area median income.Currently, a household earning $50,000 annually can afford a monthly rent of around $1,250. The dashboard also shows a growing need for home ownership opportunities with monthly mortgages ranging from $2,500 to $3,750.The City encourages residents, housing partners, and stakeholders to explore the dashboard, which is available on the Housing and Neighborhood Development section of the City of Reno’s website.\nNews Nevada Top stories\nMulti-car crash slows cars during morning commute on I-80 east in Sparks\nIncident slowing traffic on I-580 southbound near East Moana Lane\nCalmer weather with above average temps this holiday week\nFacebook\nTwitter\nWhatsApp\nSMS\nEmail\nPrint\nCopy article link\nSave\nTags\nDashboard (computing)\nSocial Issues\nEconomy\nHousing\nResidential Buildings\nPolitics\nUrban, Rural, And Regional Economics\nWatch 2 News\nMost Popular\nArticles\nVideos\nArticlesMulti-car crash slows cars during morning commute on I-80 east in SparksReno coffee shop celebrates first anniversaryOne dead, several injured in Sunday crash on U.S. 50 near Camp SacramentoWhat trends Reno shoppers are noticing while shopping for ThanksgivingPalisades Tahoe delays season openingTraffic slows on US-395 northbound near Golden Valley as crews respond to incidentMan who went missing last week found safe, Reno Police sayInvestigation underway after two cars caught fire on Kietzke LanePolice response on Bella Court leads to unexpected turn inside a Reno homeIncident slowing traffic on I-580 southbound near East Moana Lane\nVideos\nSections\nHome\nNews\nSports\nLive Stream\nWeather\nMeet The Team\nContests\nBusiness Directory\nThings 2 Do\nOnline Features\nRequest a Copy of a News Story\nServices\nPay My Bill\nFCC Public Inspection File\nFCC Applications\nKTVN Advertising Terms & Conditions\nKTVN EEO Report\nFCC Public File Help\nDo Not Sell or Share My Info\nDigital FAQ\nClosed Caption\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nContact Information\n2News.com\n4925 Energy Way\nReno, NV 89502\nPhone: 775-858-2222\nEmail: Producers@ktvn.com\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nYouTube\nInstagram\nMobile Apps\niOS App\nAndroid App\n×\nBrowser Compatibility\nYour browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.We recommend switching to one of the following browsers:\nMicrosoft Edge\nGoogle Chrome\nFirefox\n© Copyright 2025\nKTVN\n4925 Energy Way,\xa0Reno,\xa0NV\n| Terms of Use\n| Privacy Policy\nPowered by BLOX Content Management System from BLOX Digital.\nNotifications\nSettings\nYou don't have any notifications.\nGet up-to-the-minute news sent straight to your device.\nTopics\nBreaking News""]"

Bukaty \n/ \nAP\nA worker moves a steel i-beam at the site of a construction of a housing project, Thursday, July 31, 2025, in Portland, Maine.    \n\nThere is no one solution to the housing crisis in Maine. That\'s the message of Doctor Chris Herbert, managing director of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing and keynote speaker at a conference of real estate professionals in Portland this week. \nMorning Edition Host Irwin Gratz spoke with Herbert, who says on top of the rising cost of building materials, there\'s a shortage of affordable land and stubbornly high interest rates.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity.\nHebert: So if you think about where we were in 2021-2022 when the Fed started to raise rates, interest rates were at 3%. Now mortgage rates are 6.3% and house prices are higher than they were in \'21-\'22 so they\'d have to get down to 3% or 4% again to be affordable at the level they were. And I don\'t think we\'re gonna get there anytime soon.\nGratz: Maine\'s Legislature has taken a few steps in the last couple of years to encourage more affordable housing. Are there examples you\'ve seen in other states that could be a model for Maine?\n\n Community support has always powered public media, and the power to keep this vital public service going rests with you. Join us with ongoing support as an Evergreen Friend and be part of the community that ensures Maine Public remains strong. \nDonate here \n  \nYou know, I think the things that Maine has done — to allow for accessory dwelling units; to allow for multiple homes on smaller sites, sites that are well serviced by water and sewer; allowing for that higher density, smaller housing — they haven\'t had a chance to really work yet. I think that allowing that greater infill density — in a state like Maine, you\'re not going to get a lot of 6-, 10-, 12-story buildings. What you\'re going to have to do is infill in that lower-density area you have. So I would give the things that Maine has done time to work.\nCould innovations like modular home construction or even 3D printing be a part of the solution?\nYes, but I think so far, we found that there are limits to how far that will go. Part of it has to do with the scale the factories can get to. In order to have low cost, you have to have, like, Ford Model Ts rolling off the assembly line at the rates of thousands. And housing doesn\'t get built at that scale. I will say one of the solutions is sitting right in front of us, and that has achieved that scale, is the good old HUD-manufactured home. That factory-built housing is actually much more cost effective than stick-built, site-built housing. In a place like Maine, it could really fit in well. It has a stigma. People think of it as a trailer and as a mobile home. The new manufactured home, you couldn\'t tell the difference between it and a ranch home, and it really is more affordable to build.\nYeah but the other problem we\'ve run into there, and the Legislature is trying to address this as well, is that suddenly the land that people lease for these are going way up.\nI do know that Maine has passed some laws around right of first refusal. Massachusetts has had those laws, and they\'ve worked really well. But I think if what you really want to do is give people an opportunity to build wealth, thinking about getting them on their own land is also still an important avenue.\nDo we need people to be thinking differently if we\'re going to get at the housing crisis?\nWe do, and I think a lot of times the arguments about changes in housing are talking about units, and they\'re talking about affordable units, and they\'re not talking about people. Oftentimes, when we do think about those people, we tend to make them the ""other."" But I\'ll tell you, I live in a wealthy suburb in the Boston area where housing prices have gone through the roof, probably not unlike a lot of areas around Portland. And I think one of the things that\'s getting people open to the idea of broader range of housing is the fact that when I get to retirement and I want to stay in that community, I can\'t afford it. The taxes have gone through the roof. My friends are there, my church is there, my doctor is there. And so where do I go? The other thing that happens is your kids. So you want your kids to come back to town and they don\'t have a place to live. The housing market right now is not working for anyone, for the most part. And so I think, you know, we have to think about, how do we make room for our community, our family, our friends, to have a place to live here?

43,1,"New Yorker, United States",42.1497,-74.9384,0.0,"['Incumbent Muskegon Mayor Ken Johnson debated opponent Bob Garretson ahead of the Nov. 4 election in front of a sizeable crowd Sunday, Oct. 12, at the Stage at The Corner in downtown Muskegon.Photo by Ehren WynderBy Ehren Wynder | ewynder@mlive.comMUSKEGON, MI — Ahead of the November election, Muskegon Mayor Ken Johnson faced off against Bob Garrettson at a debate on Sunday, Oct. 12, at the Stage at The Corner at 280 W. Muskegon Ave. The forum-style debate was hosted by Muskegon Engaged, a local organization seeking to inform the public on political happenings. Maggie Doyle, one of the organization’s founders, and John Horne, a local high school government teacher, served as moderators.Johnson, who was first elected mayor in 2021, is running for a second four-year term on the Nov. 4 ballot. Garrettson, his opponent, is a financial planner and U.S. Navy veteran who moved to Muskegon in 2019.The mayoral race was narrowed down to Johnson and Garretson after the two were declared the top vote-getters in the August primary. Johnson came in first place with 2,043 votes, and Garretson placed second with 1,011 votes.Johnson and Garretson on Sunday evening debated a range of local and national topics, including housing, economic development and how city leaders should respond to federal issues like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).On the subject of development in the wake of the $80 million cleanup of Muskegon Lake, candidates were asked how they would ensure growth benefits longtime residents and doesn’t push them out.Garretson said his campaign commitment, “housing for all,” includes all levels from low income to luxury lakefront housing, but his primary focus is on middle-income housing.“We need to make sure that the residents that live in our downtown areas are also getting help to stay in place and age in place,” he said. “It also would free up housing that is appropriate for new homeowners.” Johnson said, while high-income housing is vital to the city’s tax base, it is important that Muskegon’s waterfront economy does not become monopolized by the ultra-wealthy.“We hear sometimes it’s too focused on low-income housing, that there’s too much of it, and that people who can’t afford to live here will just move east,” he said. “I think that’s ridiculous. We need to make sure our community is welcoming for everyone regardless of economic backgrounds.”When asked how they will strengthen the year-round economy while ensuring affordability for residents, Johnson pointed to the pay-to-park program at Pere Marquette Park, which the city uses to generate revenue for the overall parks system.With tourism, Johnson said he embraces it, but doesn’t want Muskegon to be a tourism-dominated economy. “Manufacturing has been a critical core of our economy for decades, and while it’s no longer at the height it was a century ago, it is still important,” he said. “We need to make sure that we support our manufacturers and ensure there is a future for them, because manufacturing is how we import wealth into our community.”Johnson also touted an effort he was a part of during his tenure on the city commission to halt development of the dunes at Pere Marquette.When asked how he would attract outside investment while ensuring local businesses are not left behind, Garretson said the best way for Muskegon to continue economic development is by keeping what it has. We lost large numbers of jobs from our employers, and why that happens is because we don’t have relationships with them,” he said. “When I talked to the largest employer in the city, they’ve never spoken to the city about healthcare or employment issues.”Garretson recommended partnering with cities like Norton Shores and Grand Rapids that are having a “resurgence in economic development.”When asked about their response to ICE enforcement and occupation style policing coming from the Trump administration, Garretson said upholding the safety and civil rights of the community is not enough.“We have a Latino population that’s doubled in the last 15 years,” he said. “Without that growth, we would have shrunk in our total population, but in many ways they don’t feel like they belong.”To remedy this, Garretson proposed bilingual services for businesses or people who have been victims of violent crime or people who need mental health services.In response to the same question, Johnson said communities in Muskegon have “very real fears about the march toward authoritarianism in this country.”“Members of our community feel dejected, discriminated against and in jeopardy for their lives and that requires a coordinated response,” he said.Johnson pledged his city will not do the work of ICE in Muskegon, notably because notably because it already lacks the resources.“That doesn’t mean we are going to ignore the law if there is a judicial warrant,” he said. “But we’re not going to do the federal government’s work for them in regard to ICE enforcement.”Johnson further denounced the federal deployment of troops in Chicago and Portland as “abhorrent,” and proposed Muskegon partner with nearby cities so “we are not left alone to deal with the federal government and all that entails.”Later in the debate, the topic turned to a Nov. 4 ballot initiative to impose a 12-year term limit on members of the city commission.Johnson, who previously served eight years on the city commission, may be ineligible to serve if the charter amendment is enacted. While he fully expects to serve again as mayor if elected, he warned the amendment could lead to a lengthy legal battle if also passed.Garretson said plainly that he believes Muskegon should listen to the voters. Johnson, however, noted Muskegon has a fresh and young city commission, as well as a history of turning out longtime incumbents.Candidates for city commission also took the stage Sunday night to debate one another prior to the November election. Four candidates competing for two at-large seats, including Commissioner At Large Rebecca St. Clair, Teresa Emory, Kiley N. Jackson and John C. Allen. Emory did not attend Sunday’s debate forum.The candidates in attendance debated a range of topics, including housing affordability, equitable investment in infrastructure and maintaining public land.Ehren WynderEhren Wynder is a business and development reporter at MLive.com covering Ottawa and Muskegon counties. ewynder@mlive.com']"

A Bay Area native, Tim has been a part of the CBS Bay Area newsroom for more than two decades and joined the digital staff in 2006.\nRead Full Bio\nTim\nFang,\nDa\nLin\nUpdated on:\nOctober 10, 2025 / 7:13 PM PDT\n/ CBS San Francisco\nAdd CBS News on Google\nGov. Gavin Newsom is signing a bill that would allow for more homes to be built near transit stations, in an effort to address California\'s high housing costs.In a statement Friday, the governor said he is signing Senate Bill 79, a measure sponsored by state Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco).""For too long, California has poured billions into transit without building the housing density needed for those systems to reach their potential,"" Newsom said. The governor said having more homes near transit would provide multiple benefits, including boosting ridership, cutting traffic and pollution, lowering housing costs and expanding access to jobs, schools and services.Newsom added, ""The world looks to California for leadership -- it\'s time to build modern, connected communities that fulfill California\'s promise, meeting the needs of today and the next generation.""\nThe signing of Senate Bill 79 is the latest attempt to increase homebuilding to tackle the state\'s housing costs, which remain among the highest in the country. Earlier this year,\xa0Newsom signed Assembly Bill 130 and Senate Bill 131, which reforms the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to speed up the building of housing and infrastructure. \xa0Years in the makingIn a separate statement, Wiener, said, ""In California we talk a lot about where we don\'t want to build homes, but rarely about where we do — until now. SB 79 unwinds decades of overly restrictive land use policies that have driven housing costs to astronomical levels, forcing millions of people to move far away from jobs and transit, to face massive commutes, or to leave California entirely.""\xa0Wiener, who was first elected to the State Senate in 2016, has proposed multiple zoning reform bills aiming to boost the number of homes near transit, including Senate Bill 827 in 2018 and Senate Bill 50 in 2020. Both attempts failed to gain passage in the legislature.Senate Bill 79 passed the legislature last month with a 43-19 vote in the Assembly and a 21-8 vote in the State Senate.\nWhere does SB79 apply?According to supporters, SB79 sets standards for allowable housing development within a half mile of train stops and bus rapid transit stops that meet specific criteria. The measure applies only to a handful of counties designated as an ""urban transit county"" in California, including Alameda, Los Angeles, Orange, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara counties.For qualifying ""Tier 1"" stops, which includes stops along BART, Caltrain and LA Metro\'s B & D lines, housing up to 9 stories can be built adjacent to a transit stop, up to 7 stories will be allowed within a ¼ mile and up to 6 stories will be allowed between a ¼ and ½ mile of a stop.Qualifying stops in ""Tier 2"", which include some light rail lines such as Sac RT and San Francisco Muni, some stations on Metrolink and some rapid bus transit lines, housing up to 8 stories would be allowed next to the station, 6 stories within a ¼ mile and 5 stories within ¼ and ½ mile.In his signing statement, Newsom also pushed back on claims that the bill impacts any efforts to rebuild homes that were damaged in the Palisades and Eaton fires that devastated Southern California in January, saying there are no transit stops that qualify for the measure in the burn scars of either fire and that the measure has additional safeguards for fire-prone areas.\xa0A map provided by the Los Angeles Planning Department showed where the measure could apply in the state\'s most populous city, showing no transit stops in Pacific Palisades were covered.What people are saying about the billSupporters called it a long-overdue step to boost housing supply and reduce costs. Opponents, however, warned that it could lead to overdevelopment and diminish the voices of local communities.\xa0""It\'s got the kind of quaint charm of an older city, a hometown vibe,"" said Xander Pisano, who moved to San Francisco\'s Glen Park neighborhood about eight months ago. ""It\'s also got the kind of edginess of a city on the outskirts.""\nPisano said he loves his neighborhood but worries how it might change if high-rise apartment buildings are built around the nearby Glen Park BART Station. Still, he understands the need to make housing more affordable.""If it can lower the rent, that\'s always a good thing,"" he said. ""But with that, there are pluses and negatives as well.""One of the main supporters, the non-profit California YIMBY organization, spent eight years pushing for the bill before the governor signed it into law.""It\'s a moment of validation.\nIt\'s a moment of celebration,"" said Matthew Lewis, communications director for California YIMBY. ""And really, it\'s a moment for the work to get started in actually implementing these laws.""""The affordability part of it is the big scam,"" said Susan Kirsch, founder and director of Catalyst for Local Control, a group that opposed the legislation. ""[These buildings] have no assurances, no promises of meeting the needs for those people who are living on minimum wages.""\xa0Supporters like California YIMBY disagreed, arguing that the law addresses the state\'s long-standing housing shortage through basic economics of increasing supply to help bring down prices.\xa0Office-to-home conversions, ADU building bills also approvedIn addition to SB79, Newsom announced the signing of several other measures to boost home construction, including Assembly Bill 507 by Asm. Matt Haney (D-San Francisco), which would streamline the conversion of office towers into housing.\n""Across California, commercial real estate is taking a hit. Offices are losing tenants, property values are falling, and cities are bracing for a financial crunch. AB 507 offers a solution: turn unused office space into desperately needed housing,"" said a statement from Haney\'s office.Newsom also signed Senate Bill 543 by state Sen. Jerry McNerney (D-Stockton), which seeks to streamline the construction of accessory dwelling units (ADUs), small homes also known as backyard cottages or casitas.""California needs to build housing to help make our state more affordable. And one of the most effective ways to address our housing affordability crisis is to accelerate the construction of low-cost housing, like ADUs and junior ADUs,"" McNerney said in a statement.\nMore from CBS News\nSen.

Wes Moore signed an executive order on Sept. 3 aimed at tackling Maryland’s escalating housing affordability crisis. The Housing Starts Here initiative seeks to expedite housing development, reduce production delays and make home ownership more accessible across the state. \n\nEarning enough to buy a home? See the divide across Maryland counties.

Counties like Montgomery and Howard have median home prices exceeding $600,000, making homeownership unattainable for low- and middle-income residents.  \nConversely, areas such as Allegany and Wicomico counties report median home prices below $200,000, which indicates regional inconsistencies in the Maryland housing market.  \n\nMapping Maryland’s housing crisis. Credit: Courtesy of Capital News Service \nThe executive order will broadly target each county in Maryland in order to create more housing development throughout the state.  \n\n“ says that everybody has a piece of the housing crisis, and everybody deserves for their local and state governments to be working in concert to solve that crisis,” DHCD Secretary Jake Day said.  \nIn more than half of Maryland counties, renters are spending more than one-third of their annual income on housing costs, which is considered unaffordable by federal standards.  \nWhile Maryland’s median income is 28 percent higher than the national median, the state’s median home price is 35 percent higher, highlighting the disproportionate cost of housing.  \n“How we got here is really the post-2008 financial crisis. It was real-estate driven… that had to do with risks that the financial industry took at the time,” Secretary Day said. “It led to a collapse in the economy, in residential home values and more. The over-correction of the market meant we stopped building houses at a pace that matched population growth.”  \n\nMaryland homes cost 35 percent more than the national average. Credit: Courtesy of Capital News Service \nThe Housing Starts Here Executive Order directs state agencies to identify underutilized state-owned properties suitable for transit-oriented development, aiming to increase housing density in areas with existing infrastructure.  \nTransit-oriented development is a strategy that promotes dense, mixed-use communities around transit to help increase ridership and the use of public transportation.  \n“There are a lot of benefits to it… . We want to develop state-owned land for transit-oriented development, since state-owned land is not currently taxable. There’s no revenue generation for the states or local jurisdictions. It also provides an opportunity for Marylanders to live closer to transit and use it more,” Maryland Department of Transportation’s Chief of Real Estate and Transit-Oriented Development David Zaidain said. \nAccording to Zaidain, transportation is the second biggest household budget item behind housing. It costs roughly $600 a month for Marylanders to own a car, which is pushing the state towards more transit usage.  \n\nZaidain also noted the climate change benefits that come with transit-oriented development.  \nThe executive order directs the state to speed up timelines for housing permits and establish a state housing ombudsman, or overseer, to help projects move forward.  \nThe legislation comes on the heels of a 2024 legislative package that made housing more affordable and accessible for Marylanders struggling with construction barriers, along with creating the Office of Tenant and Landlord Affairs.  \n\nProjected housing units fall short of Maryland’s 2045 goal. Credit: Courtesy of Capital News Service \nThe Housing Starts Here order also directs agencies to track housing production progress annually, coordinate with local governments to address regional shortages and ensure accountability across jurisdictions.  \n\nBy centralizing oversight and removing barriers, the administration aims to close the housing deficit and expand affordable options for Marylanders in the years ahead.  \n“When regulatory processes add cost, that cost has to be recouped – either with higher rents or a higher sales price. So, the more regulatory burden we place, the more likely it is that we’re just producing expensive for people to live,” Secretary Day said. “By cutting time and money out of the process, by streamlining it, we can make it easier to get to the finish line.” \n\nRead what we will cover next! \n132 years ago we were covering Post-Reconstruction when a former enslaved veteran started the AFRO with $200 from his land-owning wife.

David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesRachel Cohen Booth is a senior policy correspondent for Vox covering social policy. She focuses on housing, schools, homelessness, child care, and abortion rights, and has been reporting on these issues for more than a decade.Housing in America is about to get more expensive, thanks to new tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump that will take effect this Wednesday, October 1.The new tariffs include a 50 percent tax on imported kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, 30 percent on upholstered furniture, and 25 percent on heavy trucks used in construction. These will join existing tariffs on steel, aluminum, and lumber, which have been driving up construction costs this year. Back in April, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) estimated that tariffs were adding about $10,900 to the cost of building a typical new home — and that was before the steep August tariffs took effect. No doubt the October ones will only escalate the problem.Some companies stockpiled materials before the tariffs kicked in, creating a temporary buffer. But those inventories won’t last forever, and the building industry faces a fundamental challenge: Each additional $1,000 in home construction costs prices out more than 115,000 potential home-buying families, according to NAHB.This all comes at the worst possible time. Housing experts estimate the country needs at least 3.7 million homes to bring down costs and ease the severe housing shortage. More than 770,000 people were officially counted as homeless last year, mortgage rates hover around 6.4 percent, and nearly 75 percent of American households can’t afford a median-priced new home. The affordability crisis touches everyone — from renters competing for scarce apartments to homeowners delaying renovations to builders struggling with supply chain chaos. Now, tariffs are pouring fuel on these already raging fires.How tariffs hit buyers directlyWhen Trump slaps a 50 percent tariff on kitchen cabinets from abroad, American importers — not the foreign companies manufacturing the cabinets — pay that tax. They then pass those costs along to builders, who pass them to homebuyers. If a developer was planning to install $15,000 worth of imported cabinets in a new home, they’re now looking at an extra $7,500 in costs. Multiply that across appliances, fixtures, lumber, and steel, and the numbers add up fast.In total, about 7 percent of all goods used in new residential construction come from foreign countries, according to NAHB. That might sound small, but it represents $14 billion worth of materials in 2024 alone.The impact varies dramatically by location. A June study by the real estate firm Evernest found that tariffs could add anywhere from $26,180 to the cost of a new home in Oklahoma to over $100,000 in Hawaii. In expensive markets like California and Massachusetts, the additional costs from tariffs are estimated to exceed $60,000 per home.The Trump administration, for its part, maintains it holds no blame for whatever affordability crisis renters and homeowners might experience as a result of their trade decisions.“America’s housing affordability was dramatically worsened by Joe Biden’s open border policies that let tens of millions of illegal migrants walk into the country and overburden housing markets that were already grappling with cumbersome regulatory hurdles,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai told Vox. “The Trump administration is taking a multi-pronged approach to address housing affordability concerns: from mass deportations to deregulation to deflationary policies that are paving the way for further interest rate cuts.”Beyond sticker shock: Supply chain chaosThe tariffs aren’t just making materials more expensive — they’re making them scarcer and harder to predict. This uncertainty is in some ways more challenging for developers than the costs themselves. Developers planning projects months or years in advance suddenly confront moving targets for material prices, and this unpredictability is already showing up in construction data. Single-family housing starts fell to a near 2.5-year low in August, while permits — a leading indicator of future construction — dropped to levels not seen since April 2023.Developers have been sounding the alarm. Anthony Hrusovsky of Chicago’s Mavrek Development told the Chicago Tribune recently that tariffs “killed” negotiations with a major equity investor for a planned 25-story, 400-unit project. The tariffs introduced “a level of uncertainty around cost, which had previously been riskless in our eyes.”Gusto, a payroll services firm for small businesses, conducted an annual survey in August and September and found that 50 percent of companies thought tariffs had hurt their business this year, and 56 percent expected them to do so next year.Perhaps no material illustrates the tariff trap better than lumber. Canada supplies roughly 85 percent of all US softwood lumber imports and represents nearly a quarter of America’s total lumber supply. Last month, the Trump administration more than doubled its 14.5 percent tariff on Canadian lumber to a rate of 35 percent.The fact is that American sawmills simply don’t produce enough lumber to meet domestic demand, and it takes time to ramp up production. So homebuilders will face higher costs whether they buy Canadian lumber with tariffs or American lumber from a market with limited supply. And those costs will trickle down to everyone else.Tariffs hit renters, tooTariffs don’t just hit new construction — they’re expected to drive up renovation costs too. The levies on kitchen cabinets and on furniture mean that updating one’s home could get much more expensive. In effect, homeowners may become much less willing to invest in home improvements, potentially affecting property values and slowing the broader house renovation industry.For now, the NAHB is staying relatively quiet. In a statement released on Friday, the homebuilder trade group said they are working to get more details from the administration.For renters, the pain from the forthcoming tariffs will be more indirect but no less real. When it becomes more expensive to build apartments, developers build fewer of them. That tightens an already competitive rental market and makes things more costly for tenants. Some would-be homebuyers, priced out by higher home costs and mortgage rates, also remain in the rental market longer, further increasing demand for apartments.Then there are the ripple effects beyond construction. Tariffs can drive up prices economy-wide, keeping interest rates — and mortgage costs — elevated. Trade uncertainty has already rattled the stock market and slowed economic growth in 2025.Trump’s affordability promise meets realityThese tariff-driven cost increases are particularly maddening because they directly contradict the administration’s stated housing goals. Trump has repeatedly pledged to make housing “affordable again” and has signed executive orders directing agencies to reduce regulations that drive up housing costs.But while deregulation might save money on development costs, tariffs are adding thousands of dollars per home. Even if the administration could eliminate 25 percent of regulatory costs — an optimistic scenario — that still might not fully offset the price increases from import taxes. Earlier this month, the Budget Lab at Yale estimated that if current tariff levels remain steady, construction output could go down by 3.8 percent in the long run. And tariff levels are not remaining steady — they’re about to increase.Another irony is that Trump has publicly pressured the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, which would make mortgages cheaper, but his tariff policies make rate cuts less likely by fueling the inflation the Fed is trying to control.RelatedIf interest rates go down, do home prices go down? Not quite.All of these contradictions become even starker when combined with the administration’s immigration enforcement policies. More than one-third of construction workers are foreign-born, according to 2023 Census data, and in some states — like California and Texas — the share is much higher. The Trump administration’s immigration raids have already started to affect construction sites, and reports reveal that other foreign-born workers have stopped showing up to work out of fear. A July analysis from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute estimated that construction jobs are likely to be hardest hit from the president’s deportation agenda; the think tank estimated that the industry could shrink by over 18 percent.A 2024 study examining the Secure Communities immigration enforcement program (which was implemented between 2008 and 2013 and removed roughly 400,000 people from the US) found that the average county lost about a year’s worth of residential construction over four years following enforcement. New homes became 18 percent more expensive within three years, and overall home prices increased 10 percent.RelatedThe immigration crackdown threatening to break America’s child care systemThe paradox of Trump’s deportation pushThe researchers found that native-born workers didn’t replace deported immigrant workers — in fact, US-born construction jobs also declined. “You need the relatively lower-skilled folks to come in and frame the house before you need the relatively higher-skilled workers to come in and finish the house,” Troup Howard, the lead researcher, told Vox. “And so when you have net losses in those low-skilled occupations, it does lead to a slowdown overall.”For a country desperate to solve its housing crisis, Trump’s trade war is building a bigger problem, one tariff at a time.See More: Donald TrumpHousingPolicyPoliticsMost PopularTake a mental break with the newest Vox crosswordCities made a bet on millennials — but forgot one key thingThe Air Quality Index and how to use it, explainedTrump’s revenge campaign falls flatHow Zohran Mamdani won over Donald Trump — for nowToday, ExplainedUnderstand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

How are higher prices changing the way you live? Fill out\xa0this form\xa0to share your story with NPR.\nWhat\'s the issue? Home prices How have housing prices changed since before the pandemic? They\'re up 56% since February 2020, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. Why has the price gone up? There are too many buyers for too few homes. Several reasons explain the supply shortage, including a lag in home building, rising construction costs and high mortgage rates that discourage current homeowners from moving and giving up their lower rate.\nSponsor Message\nAfter Hayley Currier and \u200aTammy Kremer put in an offer on a house, they paced around the backyard of the apartment they shared, nerves jangling. ""We\'ve done everything we can,"" Kremer said. ""And all we can do is be anxious at each other,"" Currier added, before laughing. Currier and Kremer, both in their late 30s, are longtime friends who bonded over their mutual passions for open-water swimming, Jewish rituals and political organizing. They\'ve lived together for the last nine months in a rental in Berkeley, Calif., along with one other roommate.\nFriends Tammy Kremer (left) and Hayley Currier co-bought a home in the Bay Area.\nVia Tammy Kremer\nhide caption\ntoggle caption\nVia Tammy Kremer\nThis shared home has given Currier what she calls ""such a beautiful community and feeling of connection and home."" It has also confirmed for her that she and Kremer would live well together for the long term.\nEconomy\nFacing Trump\'s pressure, the Fed cuts rates for the first time this year\nEconomy\nInflation climbs in August as grocery and gas prices jump\nThe ideal arrangement, she says, is that ""Tammy and I still have intertwined lives and lives that we get to build together, but just a little bit of private space also."" Perhaps a duplex, the two of them thought, or two units on the same plot of land. So in March, they started searching for a place to buy together. The draws of co-buying\xa0 A significant number of Americans have done what Currier and Kremer are doing. Several housing industry reports from 2024 found that about 15% of homebuyers bought their home with a friend or relative.\nSponsor Message\nDaryl Fairweather, chief economist at the real estate company Redfin, got wind of the growing interest in co-buying through stories from the company\'s agents. ""\u200aWe\'ve heard of more buyers having to team up to be able to afford a home,"" she says. ""\u200aThis is a story that we\'ve been hearing really for a long time because affordability just keeps getting worse and worse."" Part of the allure of co-buying is that, in an era of rising prices, two wallets are better than one. Home prices have risen more than 50% since 2020.\nLoading...\n""Five years ago, the median household would be able to buy a typical home with room to spare,"" says Kara Ng, a senior economist at the real estate marketplace company Zillow. ""Now the median owner would need a $17,000 raise in order to afford a typical home, \u200aand that\'s assuming they already saved 20% down."" In some parts of the U.S., homeownership is even further out of reach. Ng says that in California, the median earner would need a six-figure raise. California happens to be where Currier and Kremer were looking for a home. Like other co-buyers who spoke to NPR, Kremer couldn\'t afford to buy alone, at least not where she wants to live.\nCost of Living\nHousing prices are causing some people to have smaller families than planned\nBusiness\nHome sales are ticking up — and more are coming to market\nThough housing prices are steep for everyone, Kremer and Currier have an additional economic factor working against them: They\'re single. ""There is a couple\'s advantage where if you\'re one person shopping for a home, the amount of listings you can afford is relatively small,"" says Ng. ""But the moment you partner with another person, it unlocks a whole lot of listings for you."" According to an analysis from Zillow, a couple in the U.S. earning the median income can afford nearly quadruple the number of listings as an individual buyer can. As Americans increasingly delay or forgo marriage, more and more prospective buyers are on the losing end of the couple\'s advantage.\nSponsor Message\nCo-buying with a friend or relative is a work-around, allowing people to combine income and assets, especially in areas where the housing stock is mostly single-family homes. ""If there were more duplexes or triplexes available, then people would have an easier entry point to be able to afford a home alone,"" Fairweather says. ""But since single-family homes are often the only homes available and they tend to be maybe larger than what an individual might need, it makes more sense to team up with somebody."" Obstacles to co-buying When Currier\'s mother, Sari Currier, first heard about her daughter\'s plan, she thought, ""Oh, this sounds so bad."" ""It\'s not something my generation did. You didn\'t buy property with someone else,"" she says.\nIt\'s Been a Minute\nWelcome to midlife, millennials. Are you in crisis?\nEconomy\nCould a \'silver tsunami\' of aging Americans fix the housing crisis?\nResearch backs her up. Surveys show that younger people are more likely to co-buy. Millennial homeowners were more likely to have purchased a home with one or more friends (14%) than Gen X homeowners (4%) or baby boomer homeowners (1%), according to a 2024 survey from the consumer finance company Bankrate. And a 2024 report from the insurance agency JW Surety Bonds found that 70% of Generation Z is willing to co-buy with a friend, the highest of any generation it surveyed. Sari Currier understands that homeownership has become less far affordable for younger people. But she still had concerns about her daughter co-buying with a friend. Unlike married couples, friends don\'t have built-in legal protections for splitting property if they want to part ways. So she wrote up a list of questions for her daughter and Kremer to discuss — more than two dozen. They include: If one person can\'t afford the property tax, is the other liable for the whole amount? If a problem inside one unit affects the other, who pays? What happens when one wants to sell the property? Housing experts advise people who co-buy to put an agreement in writing, as Currier and Kremer have done. ""Whether you\'re romantically involved or not romantically involved, you need to plan for those worst-case scenarios,"" Fairweather says. ""\u200aYou never know what\'s going to happen if one of you loses your job or one of you needs to move or you decide to break up.""\nSponsor Message\nCo-buying isn\'t all about money Some people don\'t co-buy solely for financial reasons. They do it for companionship. A 2024 Zillow report found that many buyers chose this route because they didn\'t want to live alone. That\'s also true for Kremer. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she\'d lived on her own in a studio apartment. ""There was something about having my own space that felt like this notion of adulthood, of having made it,"" she recalls. But she was lonely: ""\u200aI missed the feeling of coming home to people, and I missed the feeling of sharing food and being in community."" That won\'t be a problem for her anymore. Though Currier and Kremer didn\'t get the house they bid on this summer, by September they had cause to celebrate. Their offer on another property — two units on one lot, with a shared yard — was accepted. Now, it\'s possible for them to turn a design idea they\'d dreamed up into a reality: stringing tin cans between their units to talk to each other.\nhousing market\nFacebook\nFlipboard\nEmail']"

That could mean more housing options for people who make below the area median income, or AMI.\n“This is the type of housing that throughout the state, the Department of Commerce is saying is seen at the market rate level to be affordable to households as low as 50% AMI,"" Whitmarsh said. ""So, just recognizing that this has the potential to aid in filling that need without having [subsidies] like those 1590 funds or some other form of subsidized housing.”\n1590 funds are local sales tax revenues that are used to subsidize housing.\nThe city will update its code to be in line with state law by the end of the year.\n     \n Regional News  \n\nStay Connected \n \n instagram  \n facebook     \n© 2025 Spokane Public Radio.  \n\n Privacy    \n\n EEO Information    \n\n FCC Public Inspection Files    \n\n About    \n\n Contact']"
