WASHINGTON (TNND) — The Federal Reserve signaled this week that aspiring home buyers expecting more interest-rate relief may have to keep waiting. And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.

It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)

It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.

How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater Mortgages

Being “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.

But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.

Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:

27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.
18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.
10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.

The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.

When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.

What Happens When You’re Underwater?

For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.

You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.
You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.
The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.
It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.

In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.

Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?

Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.

Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”

The Upside: Lower Payments

Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)

A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.

A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.

Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.

The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger Risks

There would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example:

30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,000
50-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000

You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.

The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.

The Bottom Line

Builder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.

Meanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.

WASHINGTON (TNND) — The Federal Reserve signaled this week that aspiring home buyers expecting more interest-rate relief may have to keep waiting. And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.

It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)

It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.

How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater Mortgages

Being “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.

But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.

Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:

27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.
18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.
10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.

The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.

When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.

What Happens When You’re Underwater?

For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.

You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.
You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.
The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.
It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.

In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.

Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?

Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.

Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”

The Upside: Lower Payments

Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)

A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.

A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.

Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.

The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger Risks

There would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example:

30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,000
50-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000

You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.

The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.

The Bottom Line

Builder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.

Meanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.

2025-11-22 00:30:00,"Nov 21, 2025Housing affordability is declining faster in rural areasHousing everywhere is less affordable, but the affordability crisis is accelerating fastest in rural areas, according to an analysis by Redfin.
Housingby Elizabeth TrovallPlayListen NowSaveShareDownloadZillow found that rural homebuyers need to make about $75,000 a year to be able to afford a house now — more than double the income they needed before the pandemic.Mario Tama/Getty ImagesMany Americans chasing the dream of home ownership have turned to rural areas, where it’s more affordable and you can get more space for less. But while homes everywhere are becoming less affordable, the problem is actually accelerating faster in rural areas, according to new analysis by Redfin. When Kristin Fuerstenberg bought her cabin in northern, rural Wisconsin five years ago, it was supposed to be a part-time thing. But she loved the change of scenery.“I wake up every day, I look out at a lake, and you can't beat that,” she said.Like a lot of people who bought in the area around the time of the pandemic, she stuck around. She’s a realtor there in Oneida County and said, even now, inventory is low and prices are high. Take the home she sold earlier this year: “3 bedroom, 1 bath little ranch. $350,000. And prior to 2021, that house probably would have been $170,000.” Housing everywhere is less affordable, but in rural areas — like where Fuerstenberg lives — the affordability crisis is accelerating fastest, per Chen Zhao, head of economics research at Redfin.“Rural buyers, they have to earn about $75,000 in order to afford the typical home, and that is double what they needed to earn before the pandemic,” she said. Income has only gone up 33% in rural areas. Colorado realtor Dana Cottrell is seeing this play out in communities outside big ski destinations in the Rockies.“When you get priced out of maybe the bigger resorts, you tend to look a little further afield, and then what happens to the people that are living there, to the ranches, it becomes harder and harder for people to afford their local areas,” she said.On the flip side, Cottrell said, for those who were able to get into homes five years ago, that investment is paying off.Related TopicsCollections:HousingTagged as:Housinghousing affordabilityrural areascovid-19 pandemicOur best stories, straight to your inbox",https://www.missourinet.com/2025/11/21/missouri-housing-affordability-is-a-50-year-mortgage-the-answer/,"Missouri, United States",38.4623,-92.302,46,missourinet.com

As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%.

WASHINGTON (TNND) — The Federal Reserve signaled this week that aspiring home buyers expecting more interest-rate relief may have to keep waiting. And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.

It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.

How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater Mortgages

Being “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.

But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.

Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:

27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.
18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.
10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.

The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.

When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.

What Happens When You’re Underwater?

For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.

You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.
You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.
The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.
It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.

In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.

Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?

Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.

Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”

The Upside: Lower Payments

Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)

A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.

A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.

Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.

The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger Risks

There would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example:

30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,000
50-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000

You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.

The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.

The Bottom Line

Builder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)Comment on this story0CommentShare storySharetopics: Mortgage ratesPortable mortgagesHousing affordabilityLock-in effectHomeownershipHousing supplyMortgage-backed securitiesTariffsWASHINGTON (TNND) — The Trump administration is considering another method to bring down soaring housing costs through mortgage rates that are pricing people out of homeownership and keeping homes from coming onto the market.Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating “portable mortgages,” which would allow homebuyers to take their mortgage rate with them when they decide to move. The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.TrendingInvestigation continues into Taylor Twp. child sex ring as more victims come forwardAs the investigation continues into what's being termed a child sex ring in Centre County, police are trying to determine how many people may have been involvedPSP: Man killed in two-vehicle, head-on crash in Warriors Mark Twp.State police say one man was killed Saturday afternoon in a two-vehicle crash in Warriors Mark Township, Huntingdon County.According to a crash report, troopersJPD: One person hospitalized following stabbing in Dale Borough; suspect known to policeEmergency officials in Cambria County say one person was hospitalized Saturday evening following a stabbing along the 700 block of Bedford Street in Dale BorougPSP: Hyndman man charged for fatal truck vs go-kart crash that killed two peopleState police investigators say a Hyndman man is behind bars following a months-long investigation into a deadly Bedford County crash that claimed the lives of tReport: Tyson to close large meat plant just weeks after Trump's collusion claims Tyson, one of the nation's largest meat packing companies, is planning to close a large meat packing plant in Lexington, Nebraska.NEWS IN PHOTOS:""Local""3DA: Human trafficking charges to be filed in Taylor Twp. child sex ring investigation4Investigation continues into Taylor Twp. child sex ring as more victims come forward3Passing driver stops to help 2 trapped after I-83 crash: 'God wanted me to be there'3Warrant: Suspect in Taylor Twp. sex abuse investigation tried to buy victim's babyACCESSIBILITYDownload Our Mobile Apps:Terms & ConditionsCopyright NoticesEEO Public File ReportFCC InfoFCC ApplicationsPublic File AssistanceContactNews TeamCareersContestsNewsWeatherSportsTrafficGame CenterPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyDo Not Sell or ShareCookie Preferencestwitter iconfacebook icon 2025 Sinclair, Inc.",https://www.georgiapolicy.org/news/will-50-year-mortgages-save-the-housing-affordability-crisis/,Americans,39.828175,-98.5795,1,georgiapolicy.org

Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.Comment with BubblesBE THE FIRST TO COMMENTMeanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.TrendingFairfield man charged with making terrorist threat, held on $109,000 bondA Fairfield man is facing several charges, including making a terrorist threat.40-year-old Phillip Earl Allen, Jr., is being held in the Jefferson County Jail.Sylva man arrested for setting woman on fire during domestic dispute A Sylva man has been arrested after setting a woman on fire during a domestic violence incident.Woman convicted in Slender Man stabbing taken into custody in IllinoisAn effort to find Geyser began Saturday after police say she cut off her monitoring bracelet and left her group home.Sunshine and dry conditions stick around for the start of the holiday weekThe Thanksgiving holiday is right around the corner, but before all the feasting and family fun, we have a few more days of work.uckily for those in northern NeUber driver allegedly attacked with plastic grocery bag during delivery in south AustinPolice arrested a man last Tuesday for allegedly putting a plastic groceyr bag over an Uber delivery driver's head in south Austin.The arrest affidavit says thaNEWS IN PHOTOS:""Local""5Sunshine and dry conditions stick around for the start of the holiday week6Sunshine and cool temperatures to close out weekend in Greater Reno Area6Beautiful, sunny conditions return to northern Nevada to kick off the weekend3Eastbound I-80 reopens near Donner Summit, chains in effect on other mountain passesACCESSIBILITYTerms & ConditionsCopyright NoticesEEO Public File ReportFCC InfoFCC ApplicationsPublic File AssistanceContactNews TeamCareersContestsNewsWeatherSportsTrafficGame CenterPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyDo Not Sell or ShareCookie Preferencestwitter iconfacebook icon 2025 Sinclair, Inc.",https://www.wboc.com/news/city-leaders-focus-on-housing-affordability-in-milford/article_e026611c-896b-40b1-b4de-e61a4b869e77.html,"Sussex County, Delaware, United States",38.7001,-75.4163,4,wboc.com

 WASHINGTON (TNND) — The Federal Reserve signaled this week that aspiring home buyers expecting more interest-rate relief may have to keep waiting. And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.

It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.
How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater Mortgages

Being “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.
But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.

Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:

27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.
18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.
10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.
The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.
When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.
What Happens When You’re Underwater?
For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.

You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.
You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.
The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.
It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.
In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.
Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?
Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.
Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”
The Upside: Lower Payments

Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)
A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.
A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.
Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.
The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger Risks
There would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 

30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,000
50-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000
You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.
The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.
The Bottom Line
Builder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.

BE THE FIRST TO COMMENT
Meanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)Comment on this story2CommentShare storySharetopics: Mortgage ratesPortable mortgagesHousing affordabilityLock-in effectHomeownershipHousing supplyMortgage-backed securitiesTariffsWASHINGTON (TNND) — The Trump administration is considering another method to bring down soaring housing costs through mortgage rates that are pricing people out of homeownership and keeping homes from coming onto the market.Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating “portable mortgages,” which would allow homebuyers to take their mortgage rate with them when they decide to move. The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Comment with BubblesREAD THE COMMENTS (2)Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture.

50-YEAR MORTGAGE
NEGATIVE EQUITY

WASHINGTON (TNND) — The Federal Reserve signaled this week that aspiring home buyers expecting more interest-rate relief may have to keep waiting. And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.

It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)

It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.

How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater Mortgages

Being “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.

But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.

Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:

27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.
18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.
10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.

The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.

When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.

What Happens When You’re Underwater?

For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.

You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.
You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.
The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.
It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.

In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.

Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?

Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.

Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”

The Upside: Lower Payments

Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)

A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.

A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.

Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.

The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger Risks

There would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example:

30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,000
50-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000

You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.

The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.

The Bottom Line

Builder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.

BE THE FIRST TO COMMENT

Meanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.

DONALD TRUMP
50-YEAR MORTGAGE
NEGATIVE EQUITY

WASHINGTON (TNND) — The Federal Reserve signaled this week that aspiring home buyers expecting more interest-rate relief may have to keep waiting. And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.

It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)

It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.

How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater Mortgages

Being “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.

But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.

Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:

27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.
18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.
10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.

The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.

When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.

What Happens When You’re Underwater?

For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.

You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.
You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.
The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.
It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.

In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.

Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?

Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.

Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”

The Upside: Lower Payments

Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)

A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.

A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.

Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.

The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger Risks

There would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example:

30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,000
50-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000

You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.

The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.

The Bottom Line

Builder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.

Meanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.

The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Comment with BubblesREAD THE COMMENTS (25)Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.TrendingOregon Humane Society seeks homes for neglected Pyrenees-mix dogsThe Oregon Humane Society (OHS) is urgently seeking homes for 23 Pyrenees-mix dogs rescued from a recent neglect case.

A rent freeze just won’t work: Mamdani’s Rent Guidelines Board plan is not the answer to NYC’s housing affordability crisis

By Alex SchwartzPUBLISHED: November 23, 2025 at 5:00 AM EST | UPDATED: November 23, 2025 at 7:30 AM ESTAs the longest-serving member of the city Rent Guidelines Board, and the only member appointed by Mayor Bill de Blasio, I voted for a rent freeze in 2020, during the early months of COVID. I also authored the RGB’s subsequent order to freeze the rent for an additional six months.
I agree with Zohran Mamdani that New York’s affordable housing crisis demands immediate attention. However, I disagree with Mamdani’s pledge to freeze the rents of all rent-stabilized housing for four years. The arguments in support of a multi-year rent freeze are misguided and the consequences of such a freeze would endanger the physical and financial viability of thousands of rent-stabilized buildings, many of which were built or preserved with taxpayer dollars.
The Misleading Argument for a Rent Freeze
Mamdani and many other advocates for a rent freeze emphasize that the RGB under Mayor Adams authorized higher increases than under the previous de Blasio administration. They highlight the fact that while one-year leases under Adams increased by a cumulative 12.5% over four years, they increased by just 5.5% over the eight years of the de Blasio administration, during which time the RGB froze the rent three times (in 2016, 2017, and 2020).
These points are true, but they are also misleading. First, they overlook the fact that until 2019, when Albany passed the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act (HSTPA), landlords could raise the rent outside of the RGB’s annual adjustments.
Before that law, they could raise the rent by 18% to 20% with each vacancy, and they could increase rents by a percentage of the cost of building-wide major capital improvements (MCI) (e.g., new roofs, boilers), and of individual apartment improvements (IAI) (e.g., remodeled bathrooms and kitchens).
Indeed, many landlords relied on vacancy, Major Capital Improvement, and Individual Apartment Improvement increases to trigger what was known as “luxury deregulation.” This means that when rents reached a certain threshold (in 2019 it was $2,775) landlords could remove the unit from rent stabilization and charge whatever the market would bear. More than 170,000 units were deregulated in this way between 1994 and 2020, with most of the deregulated units being in Manhattan.
HSTPA changed all this. It eliminated deregulation (with very few exceptions), it prohibited vacancy increases, and it greatly reduced the maximum rent increase allowed for MCIs and IAIs. Starting in 2019, the only way for landlords to increase rents of rent-stabilized apartments, apart from much-reduced MCIs and IAIs, was to apply the maximum allowable increase authorized by the RGB.
That’s not all. Inflation was exceedingly low during the de Blasio years, averaging just 1.6%. This was not the case under Adams. From January 2022 through September 2025, the consumer price index for the New York region increased at an average annual rate of 4.2%. As a result, the RGB’s rent increases during the Adams administration, after adjusting for inflation, were lower than under de Blasio. In fact, they were often negative, effectively delivering rent rollbacks.
The RGB staff calculates a “composite” rent adjustment for each year, combining one- and two-year increases (about half of all rent stabilized tenants opt for 2-year leases), and through 2019, vacancy increases. This composite measure, adjusted for inflation, averaged -0.96% during the first three years of the Adams administration (the final rent adjustment just went into effect last month, and we don’t know what the inflation rate will be).
By comparison, during the eight years of de Blasio’s term, the composite rent adjustment decreased by an average of -.22% (before COVID and the concurrent spike in inflation, the average increased by 0.72%). In sum, the RGB in both the Adams and de Blasio administrations authorized very low, often negative, rent increases after adjusting for inflation.
New York City’s rent increases are also consistently lower than those of other cities and states with rent regulation. Los Angeles, for example, recently amended its rent regulations to allow annual increases to range from 1% to 4%. However, the law allows landlords to reset rents at market-levels after each vacancy. The state of Oregon, sets annual rent increases at 6% for buildings with more than 30 units, and by the lesser of 10% or 7% plus the Consumer Price Index in smaller buildings.
The Consequences of a Rent Freeze
Without adequate rental income, landlords struggle to cover the cost of maintaining and operating their buildings and to meet their mortgage payments. A rent freeze, especially the multi-year freeze that Mamdani proposes, would put tens of thousands of rent-stabilized buildings in physical and financial peril.
A freeze on rents won’t stop the cost of insurance, repairs, utilities, and other essentials from increasing. Already, more than 9% of all rent stabilized buildings, 1,563 in total, are distressed, with operating costs exceeding income. And this does not include hundreds more whose income falls short of their combined operating costs and mortgage obligations. Even more buildings hover on the brink of insolvency.
The buildings most at risk were built before 1974 and have at least 80% of their units rent-stabilized. They are mostly located in low-income neighborhoods of the Bronx, upper Manhattan, and Brooklyn. Unlike their partially regulated counterparts in core Manhattan and the more affluent sections of Brooklyn, the owners of these buildings would not be able to offset the effects of a rent freeze by charging higher rents on their unregulated units.
A rent freeze would also wreak havoc on thousands of buildings that were built or preserved with city subsidies. New York City invested more than $35 billion, adjusting for inflation, since the late 1980s on more than 640,000 housing units for mostly low- and moderate-income households. Approximately 290,000 rental units in New York City currently benefit from city subsidies. Most of this housing is subject to rent stabilization; indeed, it constitutes more than 25% of all rent-stabilized housing.
Many of these properties are already in a precarious financial condition. In testimony to the RGB and in various reports, affordable housing groups have documented the worsening financial condition of city-subsidized housing. It is being squeezed by rapidly increasing expenses and declining revenue.
Since COVID, expenses have consistently outpaced the 3% or 4% annual increases that the city typically requires to be budgeted for its subsidized housing. Average property insurance premiums, for example, increased by more than 40% over the past two years. Concurrently, rental incomes have failed to increase at the budgeted rate of 2% or 3%, and have often declined due to growing rental arrears and other factors.
A recent study published by the Association for Housing and Neighborhood Development, a coalition of more than 80 nonprofit housing groups, found that of the 112,000 units of city-subsidized housing that they could match with Department of Finance records, more than half were in the red, with expenses exceeding income. A prolonged rent freeze would only worsen the crisis, and undermine New York City’s four decades of investment in affordable housing.
The Case for Rent Subsidies
Mamdani rightly recognizes the city’s housing affordability crisis. Nearly half of all renters spend more than 30% of their income on housing, and more than a quarter spend more than 50%. When people are rent-burdened they struggle to afford food, clothes, health care, transportation, and other necessities and are too often an emergency away from becoming homeless.
But a rent freeze would do little to improve affordability for rent-burdened tenants. Instead, the city could increase its already large rent subsidy program (CityFHEPS) to enable more low-income tenants to afford their rent-stabilized homes. The city could also expand existing rent freeze programs for seniors and people with disabilities to include other low-income renters. These programs currently freeze the rent for elderly and disabled rent-stabilized tenants with incomes of less than $50,000 who spend more than 30% of their income on housing.
The city reduces the property taxes for the owners of these apartments to offset uncollected rent increases. Better yet, the city could redesign these programs to ensure that participants spend no more than 30% of their income on rent. These solutions would be costly, but unlike a rent freeze they would actually address the city’s housing affordability crisis and help maintain the physical and financial health of its rent-stabilized housing.
There have been times when rent freezes were justified, but this is not one of them. Freezing the rent now, especially for multiple years in a row, would harm tenants and their homes.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)Comment on this story1CommentShare storySharetopics: Mortgage ratesPortable mortgagesHousing affordabilityLock-in effectHomeownershipHousing supplyMortgage-backed securitiesTariffsWASHINGTON (TNND) — The Trump administration is considering another method to bring down soaring housing costs through mortgage rates that are pricing people out of homeownership and keeping homes from coming onto the market.Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating “portable mortgages,” which would allow homebuyers to take their mortgage rate with them when they decide to move. The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Comment with BubblesREAD THE COMMENTS (1)Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture.

DONALD TRUMP
50-YEAR MORTGAGE
NEGATIVE EQUITY

WASHINGTON (TNND) — The Federal Reserve signaled this week that aspiring home buyers expecting more interest-rate relief may have to keep waiting. And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.

It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)

It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.

How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater Mortgages

Being “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.

But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.

Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:

27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.
18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.
10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.

The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.

When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.

What Happens When You’re Underwater?

For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.

You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.
You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.
The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.
It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.

In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.

Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?

Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.

Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”

The Upside: Lower Payments

Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)

A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.

A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.

Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.

The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger Risks

There would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example:

30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,000
50-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000

You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.

The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.

The Bottom Line

Builder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.

JOIN THE CONVERSATION (6)

Meanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.

 Housing-affordability advocates urge city official to enact opportunity to purchase act 
 Organizations ask city officials to include TOPA in phase three of rent protections.

Housing-affordability organizations in Eugene are urging city officials to including the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act in phase three of the city’s renters protection’s process. 
Advocacy groups, including the Springfield-Eugene Tenant Association, SquareOne Villages and the Democratic Party of Lane County, advocated for TOPA during an October city council meeting to ensure renters are more aware when landlords are going to sell a building and give renters the first opportunity to purchase. 
TOPA requires property owners to notify residents if they are planning to sell their building, and give the residents a time limit to decide whether or not they will form a tenant association to find an avenue to purchase the building. 
“The residents then have a choice of either coming together to identify a property management company, or even potentially run it themselves as their own co-op and purchase the entire building, or to work with local nonprofit organizations,” Timothy Morris, executive director of SETA, said. 
For housing-affordability advocates like SETA and SquareOne Villages, the goal of TOPA is to give residents the opportunity to stay in their housing, keep prices stabilized and avoid out-of-state corporations pushing them out.

The city of Eugene’s renters protections process first came into effect in August 2022 with phase one, which saw rental protections like mandated move-in/move-out documentation by the landlord and the $10 maximum screening charge for rental applicants. Phase two went into effect in August 2023 and placed limits on security deposit maximums, requiring landlords to consider applications on a first-come first-served basis. 
According to the city’s original roadmap for the process, city officials during phase three will consider addressing issues like monthly gross income screenings, no-cause evictions and application requirements. 
“Stability and affordability comes from community ownership, and our mission is to create those democratic communities that are permanently affordable and environmentally sustainable,” Chazandra Kern, a project manager for SquareOne Villages, said. “With TOPA, we see it as one of those tools that opens up the prospects for renters to not only maintain that stability, but to become co-owners in the housing communities.” 
In Eugene, housing affordability and stability has been one of the top issues on residents’ minds, according to Celine Swenson-Harris, chair of the Democratic Party of Lane County. 
“When I am out knocking on doors, when I talk to volunteers who go out knocking on doors and come back and talk to me about the conversations they had, we see housing and affordability show up again and again. No matter where you are in this community, and across so many different age and income demographics, housing and homelessness is one of the topics that we hear pretty much every time,” Swenson-Harris said. 
The National Low Income Housing Coalition found that in Oregon, affordable rent for minimum wage-workers caps at $783 a month, but an average one-bedroom’s fair market rent is $1,435 a month. According to Eugene housing stats from January, 51% of the city’s population are renters, and 61% of them experience cost-burdens. 
Advocates are hoping that the city council will consider TOPA for phase three of the renters protection process.

The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.TrendingFairfield man charged with making terrorist threat, held on $109,000 bondA Fairfield man is facing several charges, including making a terrorist threat.40-year-old Phillip Earl Allen, Jr., is being held in the Jefferson County Jail.Sylva man arrested for setting woman on fire during domestic dispute A Sylva man has been arrested after setting a woman on fire during a domestic violence incident.Woman convicted in Slender Man stabbing taken into custody in IllinoisAn effort to find Geyser began Saturday after police say she cut off her monitoring bracelet and left her group home.Sunshine and dry conditions stick around for the start of the holiday weekThe Thanksgiving holiday is right around the corner, but before all the feasting and family fun, we have a few more days of work.uckily for those in northern NeUber driver allegedly attacked with plastic grocery bag during delivery in south AustinPolice arrested a man last Tuesday for allegedly putting a plastic groceyr bag over an Uber delivery driver's head in south Austin.The arrest affidavit says thaNEWS IN PHOTOS:""Local""5Sunshine and dry conditions stick around for the start of the holiday week6Sunshine and cool temperatures to close out weekend in Greater Reno Area6Beautiful, sunny conditions return to northern Nevada to kick off the weekend3Eastbound I-80 reopens near Donner Summit, chains in effect on other mountain passesACCESSIBILITYTerms & ConditionsCopyright NoticesEEO Public File ReportFCC InfoFCC ApplicationsPublic File AssistanceContactNews TeamCareersContestsNewsWeatherSportsTrafficGame CenterPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyDo Not Sell or ShareCookie Preferencestwitter iconfacebook icon 2025 Sinclair, Inc.",https://newschannel9.com/news/nation-world/fact-check-team-will-trumps-50-year-mortgage-idea-solve-or-worsen-housing-affordability-delay-americans-underwater-financial-borrowed-homeowner,"California, United States",36.17,-119.746,4,newschannel9.com

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.Comment with BubblesBE THE FIRST TO COMMENTMeanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.TrendingVirginia high school football coach Travis Turner goes missing amid undefeated seasonA high school football coach has gone missing in the middle of an undefeated season in Virginia.Teen going 100 mph charged with killing pregnant girlfriend in deadly 12-vehicle crashA teenager, Jose Gutierrez, 19, is facing murder charges after allegedly causing a 12-vehicle crash while driving at 100 mph in a 45 mph zone.MMA fighter, 31, dies after suffering critical injury in final round of matchA mixed martial arts fighter died at the age of 31 after sustaining a critical injury during the final round of a match.17-year-old injured in PIT maneuver after fleeing from Arkansas State PoliceThe Arkansas State Police were involved in a pursuit in Hot Spring County over the weekend.On Saturday, Nov. 22, at around 3 p.m., an ASP Trooper attempted to sErika Kirk opens up about wishing for pregnancy after husband's tragic assassinationKirk joined Megyn Kelly for a live interview on the last stop of Kelly's Sirius XM tour in Glendale, Arizona.

2025-11-19 05:15:00,"A new proposal has been pitched in the United States to address the country’s housing crisis. The Trump administration is working to introduce 50-year mortgage terms for homebuyers.Instead of the standard 30-year fixed mortgage, payments would be spread across 50 years.President Trump has framed it as a continuation of the American Dream, likening it to Franklin Roosevelt’s introduction of the 30-year mortgage.Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte has called the plan a “game changer”.AdvertisementSince the principal would be amortised over a longer period, monthly repayments would be reduced, making repayments appear more affordable to first homebuyers. As a result, younger buyers and renters would be able to enter the housing market despite high prices and interest rates.However, analysts warn that lower monthly repayments would inflate demand, pushing home prices even higher. Economists caution that the policy would worsen affordability rather than solve it.Buyers could also still be repaying mortgages well into their 70s or 80s, making it a lifetime mortgage.AdvertisementHere in Australia, several lenders have recently begun offering 40-year mortgages, some of which are solely for first home buyers.One-third of Australian adults polled by Finder said they’d take out a 40-year home loan if it meant lower monthly payments.Canstar estimated that an individual on a median full-time wage is eligible to borrow up to $24,000 more on a 40-year mortgage than on a 30-year mortgage, while a couple working full-time can borrow up to $48,000 more.AdvertisementThe following chart from Alex Joiner at IFM Investors illustrates how a lengthier 40-year mortgage term increases borrowing capacity.Longer loan terms lower monthly repayments, but lifetime repayment costs grow, and more Australians will carry mortgage debt into retirement.AdvertisementThe reality is that these types of mortgage reforms will exacerbate the housing crisis and ultimately hinder financial stability and affordability.Australia already has one of the most expensive housing markets in the world relative to our economy and household incomes.AdvertisementAllowing households to borrow more for their homes would achieve the same thing it usually does: increase debt levels and long-term housing costs.This century has supplied abundant empirical evidence for how the story will conclude. Home prices and mortgage debt will be pushed to new heights.AdvertisementThe last thing that overvalued housing markets need is more mortgage fuel being poured on the bonfire.",https://nbcmontana.com/news/nation-world/fact-check-team-will-trumps-50-year-mortgage-idea-solve-or-worsen-housing-affordability-delay-americans-underwater-financial-borrowed-homeowner,"Washington, Washington, United States",38.8951,-77.0364,46,nbcmontana.com

Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Comment with BubblesREAD THE COMMENTS (2)Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture.

U.S. metro areas seeing more transit-oriented housing projects

The Associated Press//November 24, 2025//  

Listen to this article
AT A GLANCE:
Transit-oriented housing offers affordable units near bus, rail and subway lines
Cities like Los Angeles, Boston and Washington, D.C. are gaining developments
States adopt zoning reforms to allow more dense housing near transit
Challenges include local opposition, funding gaps and rising construction costs

BOSTON — After years of living on the street and crashing on friends’ couches, Quantavia Smith was given the keys to a Los Angeles studio apartment that came with an important perk — easy access to public transit.

The 38-year-old feels like she went from a life where “no one cares” to one where she has a safe place. And the metro station the apartment complex was literally built upon is a lifeline as she searches for work without a car.

“It is more a sense of relief, a sense of independence,” said Smith, who moved into the unit in July. She receives some government assistance and pays 30 percent of her income for rent — just $19 a month for an efficiency apartment with a full-market value of $2,000.

“Having your own space, you feel like you can do anything,” she said.

Metro areas from Los Angeles to Boston have taken the lead in tying new housing developments to public transit, often teaming up with developers to streamline the permitting process and passing policies that promote developments that include a greater number of units.

Building housing near public transit helps energize neglected neighborhoods and provide affordability, city officials say, while ensuring a steady stream of riders for transit systems and cutting greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the number of cars on the road.

“Transit-oriented development should be one of, if not the biggest solution that we’re looking at for housing,” said Urban Institute Land Use Lab research director Yonah Freemark, who has written extensively on the topic. “It takes advantage of all of this money we’ve spent on transportation infrastructure. If you build the projects and don’t build anything around the areas near them, then it’s kind of like money thrown down the drain.”

The Santa Monica and Vermont Apartments, where Smith lives, is part of an ambitious plan by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to build 10,000 housing units near transit sites by 2031 — offering developers land discounts in exchange for affordable housing development and other community benefits.

In Washington, D.C., the transit authority since 2022 has completed eight projects that provided nearly 1,500 apartments and a million square feet of office space. About half were in partnership with Amazon, which committed $3.6 billion in low-cost loans and grants for affordable housing projects in Washington, as well as Nashville, Tennessee, and the Puget Sound area in Washington state. Almost all are within a half-mile of public transit.

“Big cities face the greatest challenges when it comes to traffic congestion and high housing costs,” Freemark said. “Building new homes near transit helps address both problems by encouraging people to take transit while increasing housing supply.”

In Boston, the Pok Oi Residents in Chinatown is a 10-minute walk to the subway and a half-dozen bus stops. That’s a draw for Bernie Hernandez, who moved his family there from a Connecticut suburb after his daughter was accepted into a Boston university.

“The big difference is commuting; you don’t need a car,” said Hernandez, who said he can walk to the grocery story and pharmacy. His 17-year-old daughter takes the subway to school. Now, his car mostly sits idle, saving him money on gas and time spent in traffic.

“You get to go to different places very quickly,” Hernandez said. “Everything is convenient.”

States across the country are passing laws targeting restrictive zoning regulations that for decades prohibited multifamily construction and contributed to housing shortages.

Last month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a state law allowing taller apartment buildings on land owned by transit agencies and near bus, train and subway lines.

“Building more homes in our most sustainable locations is the key to tackling the affordability crisis and locking in California’s success for many years to come,” said state Sen. Scott Wiener, who authored the bill.

California joins Colorado, which requires cities to allow an average of 40 housing units per acre within a quarter-mile of transit, and Utah, which mandates about 50 units per acre. In Washington, the governor this year signed a bill allowing taller housing developments in mixed-use commercial zones near transit.

“We want to ensure that there are mixed-income, walkable, vibrant homes all around those transit investments and that people have the option of using cars less to improve the environmental health of our communities,” said Rep. Julia Reed, who authored the Washington bill. “It’s about giving people the opportunity to drive less and live more.”

Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey has made housing a priority. Among her most potent tools is a 2021 law that requires 177 towns or communities nearby to create zoning districts allowing multifamily development. The state provided nearly $8 million to more than 150 communities to help create these zones and threatened to cut funding for those that don’t. More than 6,000 housing units are in development as a result.

“You put housing nearby public transit (and) it’s great for people,” Healey said. “They can literally get up, leave their home, walk to a commuter rail and get to work.”

Among the first to comply was Lexington, which has approved 10 projects, including a $115 million complex with 187 housing units and retail space.

Walking past earth-moving equipment and dump trucks at the construction site earlier this year, project manager Quinlan Locke said: “This is a landscape yard. It’s commercial. It’s meant for trucking. Two years from now, it’s going to be meant for people who live here, work here and play here. This is going to become someone’s home.”

Some advocates argue the lofty goals of transit-oriented housing are falling short due to fierce local resistance and lack of funding and support at the federal and state levels.

Higher mortgage interest rates, more government red tape, rising construction costs and lack of investment at transit stations also have contributed to a troubling trend — nine times more housing units built far from public transit versus near it in the past two decades, according to a 2023 Urban Institute study.

In Massachusetts, 19 communities still haven’t created new zones. Some unsuccessfully sued the state to halt the law, while residents rejected new zones in others. Lexington eventually shrank its zone from 227 acres to 90 acres after residents complained.

“If we allow the state to come in and dictate how we zone, what else are they going to come in and dictate?” said Anthony Renzoni, a selectman from the town of Holden, which sued the state and is drawing up a new zoning map after residents rejected the first one.

In Los Angeles, the six-story complex where Smith lives in East Hollywood is home to 300 new residents since opening in February. The area has gained a Filipino grocery and a medical clinic. A farmers market is set to open early next year.

Half of the building’s 187 units are reserved for formerly homeless residents like Smith, who had been living in a rundown motel via a voucher and before that on the street. She’s been assigned a case worker and is getting help with basic life skills, budgeting and finding work.

Equally important: Smith, who can’t afford a car, doesn’t need one.

“I’m very, very fortunate to be somewhere where the transit takes me where I want to go,” she said. “Where I want to go is not that far.”

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.Meanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.TrendingTwo people rescued from vault in downtown BakersfieldThe Bakersfield Fire Department responded to a call around 1:25 a.m. Sunday Morning regarding two people found in a dumbwaiter-type vault at 1918 20th St.Man found shot and killed inside east Bakersfield homeThere is significant presence of Kern County Sheriff's deputies at 2743 Center St. in east Bakersfield.The reason for the heavy law enforcement activity remainOff-roading crash near Arvin leaves one dead, another hospitalizedOne passenger died, and a driver is hospitalized after a solo-vehicle crash with an off-road vehicle in Arvin, Saturday afternoon.The California Highway Patrol Investigation underway after body discovered in southeast Bakersfield homeBakersfield police are currently investigating an active crime scene on Vancluse Bay Dr.Bakersfield police crackdown on east side encampment: 6 arrests, juvenile rescuedSix people were arrested, and a juvenile was put into protective custody following community concerns about open-air drug use and other quality-of-life concernsNEWS IN PHOTOS:""Local""3Thanksgiving travel expected to hit record high with 81.8 million travelers3California City faces leadership transition as city manager resigns3Bakersfield police crackdown on east side encampment: 6 arrests, juvenile rescued3Toys for Tots event offers family fun at Cherry AcresACCESSIBILITYDownload Our Mobile Apps:Terms & ConditionsCopyright NoticesEEO Public File ReportKBAK FCC InfoKBAK FCC ApplicationsKBFX FCC InfoKBFX FCC ApplicationsPublic File AssistanceContactNews TeamCareersContestsNewsWeatherSportsGame CenterPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyDo Not Sell or ShareCookie Preferencestwitter iconfacebook icon 2025 Sinclair, Inc.",https://ktvo.com/news/nation-world/fact-check-team-will-trumps-50-year-mortgage-idea-solve-or-worsen-housing-affordability-delay-americans-underwater-financial-borrowed-homeowner,"New York, United States",42.1497,-74.9384,1,ktvo.com

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)Comment on this story0CommentShare storySharetopics: Mortgage ratesPortable mortgagesHousing affordabilityLock-in effectHomeownershipHousing supplyMortgage-backed securitiesTariffsWASHINGTON (TNND) — The Trump administration is considering another method to bring down soaring housing costs through mortgage rates that are pricing people out of homeownership and keeping homes from coming onto the market.Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating “portable mortgages,” which would allow homebuyers to take their mortgage rate with them when they decide to move. The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.TrendingAnother milestone reached in Athletics ballpark construction in Las VegasA's team owner John Fisher and other dignitaries held a ceremonial groundbreaking for the ballpark back in June.Local attorney shares why stepfather wasn't charged in 11-year-old boy'sroad rage deathThe community is demanding answers after an 11-year-old boy was shot and killed in a road rage incident in Henderson.The suspect , 22-year-old Tyler Matthew JohFamily of woman killed in 12-car crash hold fundraiser to help with funeral costsThe family of a woman recently killed in a12-vehicle crash held a fundraiser to help with funeral costs.Adeline Duran Rincon was one of the two vicitms identifPolice investigate shots fired in central Las Vegas neighborhoodAuthorities are investigating after a shooting was reported in a central Las Vegas neighborhood Monday morning.Police release body cam video of road-rage shooting that killed 11-year-oldThe Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department has released body-camera videos showing the aftermath of a road-rage shooting that resulted in the death of 11-yearNEWS IN PHOTOS:""Local""9Police: crime down in Spring Valley, but 89103 remains among top zip codes5Federal rule change could limit nursing student loan access4NV Energy warns customers of holiday scam spike3Red Rock to limit Scenic Drive, visitor center hours on Thanksgiving DayACCESSIBILITYTerms & ConditionsCopyright NoticesEEO Public File ReportPublic Inspection FileFCC ApplicationsPublic Inspection File AssistanceContact UsContestsNewsWeatherTrafficSportsStationPoliticsAround the WebGame CenterPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyDo Not Sell or ShareCookie Preferencestwitter iconfacebook icon 2025 Sinclair, Inc.",https://fox23maine.com/news/nation-world/fact-check-team-will-trumps-50-year-mortgage-idea-solve-or-worsen-housing-affordability-delay-americans-underwater-financial-borrowed-homeowner,"Washington, Washington, United States",38.8951,-77.0364,24,fox23maine.com

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.Comment with BubblesJOIN THE CONVERSATION (3)Meanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.Trending'Pisgah Passage' becomes official name for 20-mile trail linking forest and cityAfter receiving almost 300 name suggestions from the public, the Pisgah Conservancy has officially named the ""Pisgah Passage.""Human remains found in the woods identified: Hendersonville policeHuman remains were discovered in Hendersonville, according to the Hendersonville Police Department.North Carolina Gov.

video Trump admin suggests 'portable mortgages' to fix housing crisis 'The Big Money Show' panel discusses Federal housing official Bill Pulte floating the idea of 'portable mortgages' to incentivize selling homes and revitalizing the declining housing market. The housing affordability crisis is sparing no one. But rural America is feeling particular strain. In rural America, prices continue to rise and incomes haven't kept up, according to a new report from Redfin. The convergence of both factors is causing housing affordability to ""erode faster than big cities and suburbs."" Homeowners need an annual income of $74,508 to afford a median-priced home in rural U.S. counties, up a staggering 105.8% from before the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, rural buyers only needed to earn $36,206, according to Redfin's analysis, which compares the third quarter of 2025 with the third quarter of 2019.   MORE THAN HALF OF US HOMES LOST VALUE OVER THE LAST YEAR The income needed to afford a median-priced home in suburban counties rose 90.9% to $102,120 during that same period. Previously, potential buyers only needed an annual salary of $53,482. The income needed to afford a home in urban counties climbed 87.5% to $118,300. Buyers needed an annual salary of $63,103 prior to the pandemic.

Home sale prices are hovering around $280,900, which is a far cry from the $175,000 in 2019, according to the report. Meanwhile, the median household income in rural counties is sitting around $69,307, which is only up 33.3% from before the pandemic.

Suburban counties have seen a 36.8% gain in income and urban counties have seen a 39.3% gain. EX-NYC MAYOR DE BLASIO DEFENDS MAMDANI'S RENT FREEZE PROPOSAL WHILE OTHERS WARN OF MARKET DAMAGEMillions of people relocated out of major cities during the pandemic in search of more space.

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)But the pandemic-related homebuying frenzy that swept through rural and suburban areas sent home prices soaring and left ""communities grappling with an affordability crisis that persists today,"" according to Redfin. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERETypically, rural areas only have a handful of homes for sale, Redfin said, meaning homebuyers frequently compete with one another. But during the pandemic, areas gained a lot of out-of-state prospective homebuyers. For instance, New Hampshire saw a growing interest from buyers in New York, Texas, California and Seattle, often with larger budgets. This allowed sellers to drive up the asking price, win bidding wars and purchase properties in the Lakes Region, according to New Hampshire-based Redfin Premier real estate agent Julia Martinage.""A lot of those people are now moving back to where they came from and being replaced by locals or people from border states like Massachusetts,"" Martinage said.

Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.TrendingElection recount confirms Wintersville Council results, maintains election integrityThe final steps in the Ohio general election concluded on Monday morning in Jefferson County with a recount and audit of the election results from the general eBrooke High cheerleaders win 15th state championship titleThe Brooke High School cheerleading squad has secured its fifteenth state championship title by winning the 2025 Class AAA State Championship in Charleston, WesSteubenville Nutcracker Village returns with 230 displays for holiday seasonThe Steubenville Nutcracker Village has officially returned for the holiday season, showcasing 230 life-size nutcrackers throughout downtown Steubenville.

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity.

Photo by NICK PROCAYLO /10107351AArticle contentMetro Vancouver’s housing market is cooling — but not by nearly enough to help many families priced out of home ownership. After peaking at around $1.25 million in mid-2022, the price of a typical home has fallen to roughly $1.14 million (as of September).THIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR 
Activate your Online Access NowArticle contentThat’s a meaningful drop, yet homes still cost far more than what many families can afford. Without reforms that reduce costs and delays for homebuilders, Metro’s housing crisis will continue.Article contentArticle contentArticle contentTo illustrate the scale of the problem, consider what buying a home in Metro looks like for a middle-income family. According to a new study published by the Fraser Institute, in 2023 (the latest year of comparable data), the annual median after-tax income for a family in Metro was $64,660 while the price of a typical home —  meaning a home of any type (detached, townhouse, condo, etc.) with common characteristics and amenities — was $1.17 million.Article contentThere was an error, please provide a valid email address.Sign UpThanks for signing up!A welcome email is on its way.

Metro was Canada’s second least-affordable area for renters in 2023 (again, the latest year of comparable data), with the median rental unit costing $1,715 per month — or 31.8 per cent of the median after-tax family income — up from $1,035 (26.3 per cent) a decade earlier in 2014.Article contentArticle contentAnd there’s more bad news. While the recent decline in house prices hasn’t been enough to meaningfully improve affordability, it has made it harder for builders to cover their costs, prompting a steep contraction in homebuilding at a time when the city needs more new homes.Article contentRead More

Despite hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars spent on housing initiatives by the federal government, the Eby government and Metro municipalities, including the City of Vancouver, provincial and municipal policies continue to impose needless costs, delays and restrictions on homebuilding.Article contentFor example, municipal approvals for new housing projects take twice as long in Vancouver (7.7 months) as they do in Edmonton (3.4 months) or Regina (3.2 months), owing to a complex and time-consuming permitting process.Advertisement 1This advertisement has not loaded yet.Trending Saskatchewan firm's plan to export through Washington state instead of B.C. has David Eby fuming

The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States.

Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture.

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.Comment with BubblesBE THE FIRST TO COMMENTMeanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.TrendingAnother milestone reached in Athletics ballpark construction in Las VegasA's team owner John Fisher and other dignitaries held a ceremonial groundbreaking for the ballpark back in June.Police release body cam video of road-rage shooting that killed 11-year-oldThe Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department has released body-camera videos showing the aftermath of a road-rage shooting that resulted in the death of 11-yearLocal attorney shares why stepfather wasn't charged in 11-year-old boy'sroad rage deathThe community is demanding answers after an 11-year-old boy was shot and killed in a road rage incident in Henderson.The suspect , 22-year-old Tyler Matthew JohPedestrian dies after crash near Nellis, Sahara in east Las VegasA man is dead after he was hit by a car while crossing a street in east Las Vegas on Sunday, according to police.The collision happened just after 5:50 p.m. on Nevadans reveal top three independent butchers for quality Thanksgiving turkeysAs Thanksgiving approaches, Nevadans have named their top three independent butchers in a recent poll conducted by MarketBeat, a financial media company.The suNEWS IN PHOTOS:""Local""3Family of woman killed in 12-car crash hold fundraiser to help with funeral costs4Flamingo Las Vegas gears up for milestone anniversary with new hotel, casino renovations3Aces' Gray, Young lined up for Team USA training camp3Nevada lawmakers want new hearings in Congress for potential nuclear testingACCESSIBILITYTerms & ConditionsCopyright NoticesEEO Public File ReportPublic Inspection FileFCC ApplicationsPublic Inspection File AssistanceContact UsContestsNewsWeatherTrafficSportsStationPoliticsAround the WebGame CenterPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyDo Not Sell or ShareCookie Preferencestwitter iconfacebook icon 2025 Sinclair, Inc.",https://newschannel20.com/news/nation-world/fact-check-team-will-trumps-50-year-mortgage-idea-solve-or-worsen-housing-affordability-delay-americans-underwater-financial-borrowed-homeowner,"California, United States",36.17,-119.746,22,newschannel20.com

50-year mortgage
Negative equity

 WASHINGTON (TNND) — The Federal Reserve signaled this week that aspiring home buyers expecting more interest-rate relief may have to keep waiting. And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.

It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)
It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.
How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater Mortgages

Being “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.
But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.

Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:

27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.
18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.
10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.
The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.
When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.
What Happens When You’re Underwater?
For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.

You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.
You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.
The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.
It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.
In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.
Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?
Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.
Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”
The Upside: Lower Payments

Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)
A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.
A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.
Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.
The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger Risks
There would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 

30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,000
50-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000
You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.
The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.
The Bottom Line
Builder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.

JOIN THE CONVERSATION (1)
Meanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.

Maine’s housing affordability crisis is not a zoning problem — it’s an economic one
Tue, 11/18/2025 - 10:31pm

Zoning reform has become the Legislature’s preferred answer to Maine’s housing crisis. It’s tidy, inexpensive, and offers the reassuring glow of “doing something.” But in the parts of the state where the shortage is most acute — coastal towns, service-center cities, and tourism-driven regions — zoning was never the real barrier. Treating it as the centerpiece of state housing policy has let lawmakers dodge the harder conversation: the economics of actually building housing in Maine. Communities figured this out long before Augusta. When Rockland passed a $10 million housing infrastructure bond, the goal wasn’t to squeeze more theoretical density onto a zoning map. Rockland was reacting to the real bottleneck: the cost of preparing land so housing can exist at all. Sewer extensions, water upgrades, stormwater systems, street improvements, and electrical work routinely push site costs well into six figures per unit in coastal towns. No zoning amendment fills that hole. Rockland stepped in because the State has not. The same dynamic plays out across Camden, Rockport, Bar Harbor, Falmouth, and Yarmouth. In these markets, even a modest home now costs north of $400,000 before anyone hangs a porch light. Construction bids keep climbing. Labor shortages slow everything down and raise financing costs. Infrastructure systems are aging or maxed out. Allowing a duplex, a fourplex, or a density bonus doesn’t change the reality that the underlying pro forma collapses under land prices, sitework, and interest rates. Zoning makes something legal — it does not make it feasible. Maine does have strong tools for deeply affordable rental housing, thanks to the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and MaineHousing’s gap financing programs. But for middle-income housing — the 80–140% AMI households who keep our communities running — there is no comparable support. No workforce housing fund. No soft-loan pool. No risk-mitigation tools for small developers. No statewide infrastructure program. Without these tools, zoning reform simply rearranges possibilities on paper. If the Legislature wants progress where it matters most, it needs to pivot from land-use theory to development economics. That means legislation that gives communities and builders the tools required to close the gap between feasibility and construction. A State Housing Infrastructure Fund should be the starting point. Local governments cannot absorb multi-million-dollar sewer and water upgrades one project at a time. A statewide program — grants or zero-interest loans tied directly to housing creation — would immediately unlock stalled sites in workforce-strained communities like Rockland, Camden, Bar Harbor, Bethel, Farmington, Rangeley, and Greenville. Maine also needs a Workforce Housing Finance Program aimed squarely at the missing middle. Soft second loans, forgivable loans, and construction-to-permanent financing for 80–140% AMI units would mirror MaineHousing’s successful affordable rental programs but serve the segment where demand is highest and financing gaps are widest. A Predevelopment and Risk-Mitigation Fund would give smaller developers a fair shot. The modest projects best suited to Maine’s villages and walkable neighborhoods often die before they start because engineering, environmental review, and early design come with real financial risk. A state backstop for part of these costs — paired with partial guarantees on construction loans — would help more builders take on small-scale, infill, and missing-middle projects. The Legislature should also create a State Workforce Housing Tax Credit, a targeted version of the federal LIHTC model but tailored to middle-income rental and ownership units. Even a modest credit would attract equity and help close financing gaps in high-cost towns. Finally, Maine should modernize Affordable Housing TIF so municipalities can use it to support workforce housing, not just deeply affordable units. Communities willing to put their own skin in the game — through bonds, infrastructure commitments, or land contributions — should be eligible for matching funds or enhanced TIF flexibility. Municipalities are already stepping up. Rockland has bonded for infrastructure. Communities across the state — Bangor, Brunswick, Yarmouth, South Portland, Scarborough, and others — have rewritten zoning, identified sites, and streamlined permitting. But they cannot fix the fundamental cost structure alone. Zoning sets the stage; economics determines whether anything ever gets built. If Maine wants more homes in the communities where workers are being priced out, the Legislature needs to move beyond symbolic zoning tweaks and adopt the financial tools that actually make housing possible.

Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.Meanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.TrendingWoman taken into custody after police chase throughout multiples counties reached 110 mphA 41-year-old woman was taken into custody after a long high-speed pursuit.Crews battle blaze at Frankenmuth office buildingMultiple fire departments were called into assist the Frankenmuth Fire Department battle a blaze at a commercial office building on Sunday night.MMA fighter, 31, dies after suffering critical injury in final round of matchA mixed martial arts fighter died at the age of 31 after sustaining a critical injury during the final round of a match.Dispensary that recently became a 24-hour business hands out 100 free turkeysGENESEE COUNTY, Mich. &ndash; A local business that recently made the decision to become a 24/7 operation spent time on Monday giving back to the community.Gramz CannOver $20,000 in Flint bus passes to be donated for people seeking assistancePeople seeking support from some local non-profits can get a free bus ride during the holiday season.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)Comment on this story0CommentShare storySharetopics: Mortgage ratesPortable mortgagesHousing affordabilityLock-in effectHomeownershipHousing supplyMortgage-backed securitiesTariffsWASHINGTON (TNND) — The Trump administration is considering another method to bring down soaring housing costs through mortgage rates that are pricing people out of homeownership and keeping homes from coming onto the market.Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating “portable mortgages,” which would allow homebuyers to take their mortgage rate with them when they decide to move. The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.TrendingCity of Amarillo names 3 finalists for the next police chiefThe City of Amarillo named three finalists for the next chief of the Amarillo Police Department.The finalists are interim Chief Jimmy Johnson,Thomas Hover and Erika Kirk opens up about wishing for pregnancy after husband's tragic assassinationKirk joined Megyn Kelly for a live interview on the last stop of Kelly's Sirius XM tour in Glendale, Arizona.

(TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth.

That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%.

The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States.

Faith leaders called for housing affordability and a repeal of the city’s business tax cuts last week during a series of press conferences in neighborhoods across the city including the Northwest. 
Five of the press conferences hosted by POWER Interfaith, a multiracial and multifaith social justice organization, were in Germantown and Mt. Airy. POWER Interfaith’s goal is to pressure City Council into intensifying efforts to address the current housing affordability crisis Philadelphia residents are facing. 
Faith leaders specifically focused on City Council’s June 12 decision to gradually reduce Business Income and Receipt Tax (BIRT), citing potential harm to the city’s working class and most vulnerable residents. 
The BIRT tax is the third-largest source of tax revenue for the city, paid for by business owners or companies engaged in for-profit activity within the City of Philadelphia. The tax is not levied on residents who are not business owners. 
“Cutting business taxes is estimated to cost the city $2.8 billion over 12 years, removing significant dollars from the city budget and forcing residents to shoulder more of the burden,” Jayson Massey, a member of Germantown Friends Meeting, said at a press conference Saturday outside Germantown High School. 
He added, “We are here today in front of the former Germantown High School to show the crisis of affordable housing in Germantown, and also to show that the loss of Germantown High School did not result in usable, safe, and affordable housing for the residents here in Germantown. This neighborhood, with a median income of only $45,727, does not need luxury apartments.” 
The high school building, which closed in 2013, has been converted into an apartment complex called The Annex at Germantown, where rents begin at $1,050 for studio apartments, according to rent.com. 
Along with Germantown and Greene Street Friends Meeting, Northwest faith groups and congregations joining the initiative to lobby for affordable housing include St.Vincent de Paul Catholic Church, Faith Chapel, Face to Face Germantown, Mishkan Shalom synagogue, First United Methodist Church of Germantown (FUMCOG), Second Baptist Church of Germantown, and Unitarian Universalists of Mt. Airy. 

On Wednesday, Nov. 12, FUMCOG co-hosted one of the press conferences, with their senior pastor, the Rev. Alisa Lasater Wailoo, speaking on the issue of affordability. 
“When I arrived here about three years ago, I would say we got about two calls a week for folks in need. We’re now getting about a dozen calls a week, easily,” Wailoo said. “We get calls from young mothers. And it’s not just calls, members of our church, we have seniors who don’t know if they’re going to be able to turn on their heat. We have veterans who wonder about their medical bills. And we have working folks of every race, every gender, every orientation, and background that are struggling.” 
At Saturday’s press conference in front of Germantown High School, several speakers and attendees joined the group of faith and civic leaders including City Councilmember Nicolas O’Rourke and Seth Anderson-Oberman, who ran against Councilmember Cindy Bass in 2023. 
O’Rourke, along with fellow Working Families Party City Councilmember Kendra Brooks, opposed the decision to phase out the BIRT tax. 
“There are very few issues that are as constant as the cost of housing and the terms on which you secure it,” O’Rourke said. “The city’s widest housing gap is the shortage of almost 65,000 units, affordable and available to those with the lowest incomes. That’s a problem.” 
He then discussed what he described as a weakness in Mayor Cherelle Parker’s housing plan. 
“The mayor’s plan for housing, which I have said, and I will say again, does have its fair share of bright spots … But something a number of my colleagues and I have raised was the importance of codifying that most of the plan’s funding goes towards those making the least. Codifying it, not just stating an intention but writing that intent into the letter of the law,” O’Rourke said. “The administration flatly refused to do this a couple of times.” 
He added, “We know there’s no housing gap for luxury apartments. You see them all over the place, and they’re good and empty … Everyone further up the income scale has a unit that’s available to them, though it may not be their dream apartment. It may not be the exact thing that they’re looking for; it may not hit all of their preferences. It may not be the perfect setup, but they can’t afford it. With this in mind, I simply don’t see why we aren’t being clear about working for those who simply don’t have an option that they can afford.” 
Kadi Ashby, the president of the Alden Park Tenants Association, shared her experience as a tenant. When she organized the tenants group early this year, Ashby and her neighbors fought for better maintenance and responsiveness from their building’s management company. 
After months of organizing, she received an email from property management denying her a lease renewal, without providing a reason. 
“I am left unable to afford to move. I’m unable to find a comparable apartment in my neighborhood, and it’s possible that this will force me out of my community, the community that, through all of this, has shown me overwhelming support,” Ashby said. ‘We need all of our city council members to commit to fighting gentrification and the corporate landlords taking over our neighborhoods.” 
One goal of O’Rourke’s office has been to push for better protections for renters, including a bill that would require “good cause” for denying a lease renewal. This effort would protect tenants who attempted to organize from retaliation. 
Anderson-Oberman, who is currently the executive director of the advocacy group Reclaim Philadelphia, ran on a progressive platform, narrowly losing to Bass in the 2023 Democratic primary. On Saturday, he discussed his own family’s struggle with affordability and the actions he believes the city must take to address the housing crisis. 
“The private sector alone, the so-called free market, is never going to solve this crisis. If the private sector were going to build deeply affordable housing for working-class families, they would have done it already,” Anderson-Oberman said. “That’s why our government — city, state, and federal — must step in and build the housing that we actually need. We need public investment. We need government-funded social housing that is mixed-income and permanently affordable.” 
Work ahead 
On Feb. 1, Power Interfaith will host a Citywide Affordability Summit, inviting City Councilmembers to speak with faith leaders, advocates, and residents about a long-term solution to the shortage of affordable housing and other affordability issues. 
Reflecting on the week of press conferences, Meg Cruz, the Northwest organizer for POWER Interfaith, told the Local, “I think it was a super powerful week of action where we saw over 20 of our congregations who were represented at these different press conferences. We had everyday people speaking out about how the affordability crisis impacted them and what the implications of this loss of [BIRT] funding would be like.” 
She added, “This is a crisis that is really escalating at a scale that is impossible for people to withstand within their own means, and the decision to eliminate business taxes makes that worse.”

WASHINGTON (TNND) — The Trump administration is considering another method to bring down soaring housing costs through mortgage rates that are pricing people out of homeownership and keeping homes from coming onto the market.
Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating “portable mortgages,” which would allow homebuyers to take their mortgage rate with them when they decide to move. The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.
Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.

Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.

“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down.

2025-11-19 03:45:00,"A new HousingWire Data deep-dive confirms widening affordability gaps and rising inventory in previously constrained markets — as well as strong regional patterns that favor the South for balance and the Midwest for price relief.
Pittsburgh continues to stand out as the nation’s most affordable major metro, with a median list price of $240,000. Its price-per-square-foot of $167.55 also positions it well below national averages.
Despite that affordability, the market is far from sluggish.
Pittsburgh posts a 35.5 Market Action Index (MAI), placing it in seller-leaning territory as the market carries just 2.5 months of inventory.
MAI is HousingWire Data’s proprietary measure of market heat that ranges from 0–100 and gauges the balance between supply and demand.
Deb Reddick, a Realtor at Pittsburgh-based REMAX 360 Realty, noted that demand is supported not just by low prices, but by strong fundamentals in the region.
“One of the reasons people move here is we have excellent medical facilities, that makes people want to be here and it makes them feel like they’re in good hands,” she said. “We’re not seeing prices climb as high here as other places, and it’s hard to point to one or a few reasons why that is.
“We’ve had a lot of building and improvement lately, too. The roads make it so if you live just outside of downtown, it’s not hard to get in. It’s all tied together nicely.”
The metro also reports a strong 10.2% weekly absorption rate — the highest among key metros reviewed — and a 4.4% year-over-year price gain, signaling healthy and sustainable appreciation.
Homes average 63 days on market, and nearly half of active listings take price cuts, yet sellers still maintain leverage due to tight supply.
Reddick adds that Pittsburgh’s growth has remained measured in part because home values started from a lower base.
“Well, I think, honestly, they were lower to begin with, and with them climbing they’re not keeping in line with the other cities,” she said. “We’ve also had a lot of new building and construction — a lot of new high rises and condos.”
Austin’s inventory surge
Austin, Texas, once among the most supply-constrained markets in the country, now posts one of the strongest inventory totals in the analysis with 10,867 active listings.
With 505 new listings added each week, Austin’s supply pipeline remains robust.
Inventory is up 19.1% year-over-year — the sharpest increase among major metros.
Despite a recent 5.1% price dip, the market operates at a balanced MAI of 33.1, suggesting buyers have more choice than they did during the pandemic boom but still face competitive conditions.
Matt Menard, broker-owner at ERA Real Estate Experts in Austin, notes how stark the shift has been from pandemic-era scarcity
“We were certainly one of the hottest markets in the country during COVID, and during that period of time, we had an inordinate amount of growth and appreciation,” he said. “There was a time when our inventory levels were about a half a month or less, and then now we’re pushing five months of inventory and 80-plus days on the market.”
Homes average 84 days on market and price-per-square-foot sits at $225.03.
Menard emphasized that despite the cooling, the market remains active and offers opportunity.
“We’re still seeing a relatively good sales pace,” he said. “Inventory is just hanging out there. The number of sales are still relatively strong. We’re just seeing properties take a little bit longer to sell, and I think for buyers, it represents an incredible environment.
“It’s a chance to buy when the market is much more forgiving. I’m telling buyers that it’s kind of like a Black Friday sale this quarter, and people are going to look back in a year or two and wish they had bought real estate during this time period.”
Cape Coral–Fort Myers tops in supply
Cape Coral–Fort Myers stands out for its unusually high inventory relative to demand conditions.
With 7,910 active listings — the 15th highest total nationally — the market is firmly in buyer-friendly territory at an MAI of 27.0.
Its 4.6 months of inventory is the highest among the major markets reviewed, giving buyers substantially more leverage than in tight coastal metros.
Year-over-year prices have adjusted downward by 6.4%, and homes stay on the market for an average of 119 days, one of the longest timelines.
West Coast, Midwest affordability opposites
Los Angeles remains the least affordable major metro in the country with a median price of $1,429,500 — roughly 703% higher than Pittsburgh. The metro commands an extraordinary $703.19 price-per-square-foot, more than doubling most markets analyzed.
Despite slight price softening, Los Angeles posts a strong seller MAI of 42.8 and has the tightest inventory conditions among major metros at just 1.8 months of supply.
HousingWire Data confirms that 10 of the top 25 most affordable metros are located in the Midwest, more than any other region.
The region posts the lowest average median price nationally at $311,937 and the strongest market activity with an average MAI of 39.3.
Metros such as Danville, Ill.; Decatur, Ill.; Saginaw, Mich.; and Peoria, Ill. all rank among the country’s most affordable, with many median prices falling below $170,000.
Finding balance in the South
The South — which contains 129 metros in the HousingWire’s data — continues to deliver the strongest combination of affordability and market balance.
The region’s average median price of $362,244 ranks as the second most affordable nationwide, and its average MAI of 32.3 suggests generally buyer-friendly conditions.
Notable performers include Oklahoma City, Little Rock, Ark.; Austin, and Nashville, Tenn., — all of which maintain market balance while offering comparatively lower prices than coastal peers.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)Comment on this story0CommentShare storySharetopics: Mortgage ratesPortable mortgagesHousing affordabilityLock-in effectHomeownershipHousing supplyMortgage-backed securitiesTariffsWASHINGTON (TNND) — The Trump administration is considering another method to bring down soaring housing costs through mortgage rates that are pricing people out of homeownership and keeping homes from coming onto the market.Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating “portable mortgages,” which would allow homebuyers to take their mortgage rate with them when they decide to move. The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.TrendingFLORIDA INTENSIFICA ALIANZAS CON ICE: PALM BEACH LIDERA EN ENCUENTROS MIGRATORIOSLas agencias policiales de Florida están ampliando aceleradamente sus alianzas con autoridades federales de inmigración, impulsando un aumento significativo en'Don't die': Florida homeowner expresses remorse after fatal shooting of alleged intruderA Miami-Dade homeowner is expressing deep remorse after fatally shooting a man who allegedly barged into his home late Saturday night. 23-year-old man dies after shooting in Fort Pierce, information soughtA 23-year-old man died following a shooting on Monday.PHOTOS: Semi-truck crashes into canal after veering off Florida's Turnpike A semi-truck veered off Florida’s Turnpike and ended up in a roadside canal on Monday.Virginia high school football coach Travis Turner goes missing amid undefeated seasonA high school football coach has gone missing in the middle of an undefeated season in Virginia.NEWS IN PHOTOS:""Local""3Could you have the winning ticket?

Despite these obstacles, more firms expect profitability to increase

Washington, Nov. 19, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Real estate firms are bracing for continued challenges related to housing affordability and rising industry costs, according to the 2025 Profile of Real Estate Firms published by the National Association of REALTORS® today.

Top challenges for real estate firms:

Housing affordability (56%)
Industry costs (36%, up from 34% in 2023)

Despite these challenges, 38% of firms expect their profitability to increase in 2025, up from 30% in 2023-the last time this survey was conducted.

""Real estate firms are on the frontlines of the industry and are seeing firsthand how housing affordability and local economic conditions are impacting their clients,” said Jessica Lautz, NAR deputy chief economist.

2025-11-19 03:30:00,"The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA)’s Purchase Applications Payment Index (PAPI) for October showed that homebuyer affordability improved for the fifth consecutive month, with the national median payment applied for by purchase applicants decreasing to $2,039 — down from $2,067 in September.
MBA‘s PAPI measures how new monthly mortgage payments vary across time, relative to income, using data from the trade group’s Weekly Applications Survey.
Edward Seiler, MBA’s associate vice president of housing economics and executive director of the Research Institute for Housing America, said that the streak of improved affordability conditions is tied to lower mortgage rates, higher household earnings and flattening home-price growth.
“The median purchase application payment amount in October was $88 lower than one year ago. Affordability is improving — PAPI is at its lowest level since March 2022— and is likely to continue to as mortgage rates hold to around 6% and more supply comes onto the market,” Seiler said.
An increase in MBA’s PAPI indicates declining borrower affordability conditions, and that the mortgage payment-to-income ratio is higher due to increasing application loan amounts, rising mortgage rates or a decrease in earnings.
Conversely, a decrease in the PAPI indicates improving borrower affordability conditions and occurs when loan application amounts decrease, mortgage rates decrease or earnings increase.
The national PAPI fell 1.6% to a reading of 152.0 in October, down from 155.0 in September, reflecting a 4.2% drop in typical mortgage payments. And earnings growth pushed affordability up 5.5% on an annual basis.
For borrowers applying for lower-payment mortgages, at the 25th percentile, the national payment fell to $1,402, down from $1,418 the previous month.
The national median mortgage payment in October was $2,039, down $28 from September and $88 lower than a year earlier. Federal Housing Administration (FHA) borrowers saw their median monthly payment dip slightly to $1,789, compared to $1,792 in September and $1,842 in October 2024.
Conventional loan applicants, meanwhile, reported a median payment of $2,063, down from $2,105 the month prior and $2,134 a year earlier.
The states with the highest PAPI readings — meaning the least affordable markets — were Idaho (238.0), Nevada (230.7), Rhode Island (199.4), Arizona (198.6) and Tennessee (192.8). The most affordable markets were Louisiana (113.5), Connecticut (116.2), Washington, D.C. (118.6), Hawaii (123.6) and North Dakota (124.9).
Affordability improved across demographic groups. The PAPI for Black households fell to 151.5 in October, down from 154.4 in September. Hispanic households saw their index score decline from 144.3 to 141.6 during the month, while the reading for white households eased from 156.0 to 153.1.

A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.TrendingMan found dead in wheelchair on side of road in Tysons A man was found dead in a wheelchair on the side of the road in Tysons, Va.Driver killed in single-vehicle crash in Montgomery CountyA driver is dead following a Sunday night single-vehicle collision in Montgomery County, according to police.

The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates.

On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy.

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.Comment with BubblesREAD THE COMMENTS (11)Meanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.TrendingWashington state crackdown uncovers 41 unlicensed contractors in two-day operationIn a sweeping two-day enforcement operation, the Washington State Department of Labor & Industries (L&I) uncovered 41 cases of unlicensed contractors.

The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.TrendingReport: Tyson to close large meat plant just weeks after Trump's collusion claims Tyson, one of the nation's largest meat packing companies, is planning to close a large meat packing plant in Lexington, Nebraska.10 people displaced after fire in WestbrookCrews on scene of a structure fire in Westbrook.

MILFORD, DE- Affordable housing concerns took center stage in Milford Wednesday night as the City Council hosted a workshop on development, land use, and strategies to address growing housing demand.Last night, the Milford City Council hosted housing officials from the Delaware State Housing Authority and Sussex County Habitat for Humanity, who shared insights on development trends and ways to expand affordable housing options.Growth in Milford is visible across town, with new homes, cleared land, and construction equipment dotting the landscape. But city leaders say what isn't rising fast enough are homes that people can afford.Milford Mayor Todd Culotta said many neighbors are spending too much on housing.""The rule of thumb is 30% of your income should be spent on housing. No more than that. And one out of three Sussex County people spend more than that on housing.""A recent city report shows Milford is adding roughly 200 new homes a year. At that pace, it would take 17 years to finish all approved projects and about 20 years to complete everything approved and proposed. City data estimates it would take 36 years to fully develop all currently vacant residential land within the city limits at the current rate.However, Culotta said the issue isn't growth — it's affordability.""We do not have an overgrowth problem in Milford. In fact, we have a housing crisis. And it's not just affordable housing. It's a housing crisis for everybody.""Slides presented to the council by Matthew Heckles of the Delaware State Housing Authority illustrated what affordability really means for families at different income levels, highlighting the limited options available to lower-income households.""I'm talking about 30% of AMI, or we focus a lot on 50% of the area median income… that's about a $30,000-a-year income for a family. Which means you can only afford about $800 in rent in Milford. And there just aren't enough units like that.""Heckles said Milford is making strong investments and doing a good job, but the city still needs a wider mix of housing types to meet demand.""This is something that the council asked about, too… what kind of housing and what price point should we be looking at? And the answer is all of them.""With Delaware facing a shortfall of roughly 50,000 homes, Heckles said new construction must prioritize affordability.""I think what we need to do is think about how to develop more smartly, and make sure that the types of development that are going through are affordable homes.""After the workshop, Culotta said the city plans to revisit its master plan, review its layout, and make adjustments where needed, with a focus on mixed-use development.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)Comment on this story0CommentShare storySharetopics: Mortgage ratesPortable mortgagesHousing affordabilityLock-in effectHomeownershipHousing supplyMortgage-backed securitiesTariffsWASHINGTON (TNND) — The Trump administration is considering another method to bring down soaring housing costs through mortgage rates that are pricing people out of homeownership and keeping homes from coming onto the market.Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating “portable mortgages,” which would allow homebuyers to take their mortgage rate with them when they decide to move. The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.TrendingIs there price-fixing in the beef industry?Beef prices aren't likely to move much after Tyson Foods announced the closure of one of its plants, according to an agricultural economist.Experts share tips for enjoying a heart-healthy Thanksgiving without sacrificing traditionStruggle with making your food heart-healthy?

2025-11-19 02:45:00,"President Donald Trump’s new idea of offering homebuyers 50-year mortgages to reduce costs would likely lead homeowners to pay more in the long run, Maine home affordability experts say.
The Trump administration’s pitch, floated earlier this month on Truth Social, proposes offering homebuyers a 50-year mortgage to pay off the loan for their new property, as it would lead to smaller monthly payments and make homeownership more attainable for more Americans who are priced out of the market.
The median cost of a single-family home in Maine reached more than $401,000 as of last month, putting the dream of homeownership out of reach for many. That’s a stark difference from five years ago when the average price of a home in Maine hovered around $265,000.
A plan that could lower monthly mortgage payments can seem appealing, especially in southern and coastal Maine where average housing prices have skyrocketed in recent years while median incomes haven’t kept up, said Laura Mitchell, executive director of the Maine Affordable Housing Coalition.
But a 50-year mortgage “is really setting people with those with those lower incomes up for a bad investment and something that they’ll never work their way out of,” Mitchell said.
That’s because homeowners with a 50-year mortgage would be paying off their debt for far longer and building more interest during that time than if they had a 15- or 30-year mortgage, Mitchell said.
“The total amount that you pay is way higher than the actual value of the home will ever be because you’re paying way more in interest,” Mitchell said. “It makes it a bad investment because you’re never going to have ownership within your lifetime and you’re paying more towards the cost of the home.”
Someone buying a $400,000 home with a typical 20% down payment and an interest rate of slightly under 6.5% would have monthly mortgage payments of about $2,700 over the 30-year loan term, according to Nerdwallet, a personal finance company.
At the end of the 30-year life of the loan, the homeowner will pay $727,000 for the house. Of that, $407,000 will go toward interest.
If someone were to opt for a 50-year fixed-rate mortgage on a $400,000 house with the same interest rates, the monthly mortgage payments would be roughly $250 cheaper than if they had a 30-year mortgage, according to Al Butler, senior vice president and director of special assets at Camden National Bank.
While that may help some homeowners in the short term, Butler said they’ll wind up paying $500,000 more in interest over the life of the deal.
“We just aren’t seeing any advantage to this,” Butler said of Trump’s idea. “We have to get more creative with providing affordable housing than longer term mortgages. We just don’t think that’s the right route at this point.”
Further details on Trump’s idea, such as what the interest rates on a 50-year mortgage would be, are still unclear, Butler said.
Mitchell and Butler agreed it’s time to think of new ways to make homeownership more affordable to more Mainers, but longer mortgages likely aren’t the solution. Instead, they pointed to lowering the cost of home construction materials and labor as more assured ways to lower home prices.
The 50-year mortgage idea also comes at a time when the average age of first time homebuyers has crept up to 40 nationwide, according to the National Association of Realtors. This means a 50-year mortgage could “set people up to be in debt beyond their lifespan and not actually gain the equity and freedom of home ownership that’s the American Dream,” Mitchell said.

2025-11-19 02:45:00,"The sweeping economic interventions launched during the Covid-19 pandemic may have made American homes less attainable for millions—a reality the housing market will need years, if not decades, to correct, warns top real-estate executive Sean Dobson. The Amherst Group CEO, whose subsidiary Main Street Renewal is one of the country’s largest institutional landlords, told ResiClub‘s Lance Lambert that he believes the aftershocks of loose lending in the run-up to the Great Financial Crisis, and massive stimulus and abrupt policy pivots in the years since, have fundamentally altered the homeownership landscape for an entire generation.​Recommended VideoDobson, in conversation at the residential real-estate conference ResiDay, reflected on the question of what the U.S. is going to do for the family out there that wants to buy a home. “We think the unfortunate part … really the cost of economic policy response to COVID is that we’ve probably made housing unaffordable for a whole generation of Americans.”Dobson estimated that it will probably take 10 or 15 years of steady income growth to get affordability back to something approaching fairness, referencing postwar to pre-2006 norms. He placed the blame squarely on a combination of pandemic-era monetary policy, describing economic policy as “reckless” as well as surging asset prices and stagnant wage growth. “Affordability has probably never been as bad as it is today, the way that we measure it,” Dobson said—worse, even, than the feverish markets of 2006.​ “You’ve got to be very, very careful.”On the sidelines of the conference, Dobson told Fortune that “rental is going to have to become a part of the solution,” not just because he’s invested in the success of his firm but for the health of the country. “What are our goals?” Dobson asked hypothetically. “Is our goal to get everyone long real estate? Or is our goal to get everybody to live where their kids can go [to a good school] and be successful?” He said the housing industry is facing a big, obvious problem. “In reality, the problem is that homeownership is too difficult to reach, and there aren’t enough homes – across all types and price points – to meet consumer needs.” A representative for Amherst said this is “the least affordable period in modern history” for housing, noting that the PITI (Principal, Interest, Taxes and Insurance) on an FHA-insurance mortgage with a 97% loan-to-value ratio currently consumes about 42.9% of median income. That is slightly higher than 2006 averages of 41.5%, and well above the longer-term 25%-35% range.The Price of Economic FirefightingWhat was so reckless about U.S. economic policy, according to Dobson? A brief refresher on the last decade-plus and the era of quantitative easing is required.The onset of Covid-19 triggered trillions in government spending and ultralow interest rates as the Federal Reserve returned to the playbook that was improvised in the crisis of 2008. While meant to stave off recession and mass unemployment, this “easy money” era sent home prices and rents skyrocketing.Dobson told Lambert that this set of government and Fed policies, though well-intended, created new winners and losers in the housing market. “There’s a tax on the U.S. economy that’s almost 200 basis points because of the shoot-up that occurred. And the Fed needs to get rid of that tax,” he said, pointing to persistently high mortgage rates and nominal rates that are “probably 1 [percent] higher than they’re supposed to be given the rate of inflation that we have.”Amherst’s own analytics show just how far out of reach the average home has become. Right now, “you’re so far away from fair value,” he said, that “you can only reach affordability one of three ways: by changing the price of the home, the price of the money, or the income of the family.” An Amherst Group representative provided internal estimates projecting that, for housing affordability in the U.S. to get back in line with 2019 levels, the price of the home would need to go down 35.3%, interest rates to go down 4.6%, or income to go up by about half (55%). None of these is plausible on their own, Dobson told Lambert, and only incremental progress is likely as incomes, prices, and rates gradually realign over many years.​Credit constraints are another culprit: while post-crisis regulations have shored up mortgage lending standards, they have also squeezed out borrowers with lower credit scores—historically, a large swath of would-be first-time buyers. “Subprime mortgages were serving millions of Americans to get them to buy homes … when Dodd-Frank was passed, there was a maximum credit risk allowed on the table. That only serves the top 25% of the consumer base,” Dobson explained. As a result, lending criteria systematically exclude half the market, leaving many Americans as permanent renters despite wanting homeownership.​The reason these were called subprime wasn’t because they were junk, he added, they were simply mortgages for people with below-average credit scores. He asked the crowd if they knew what it took to go from a 745 FICO score to a 645 FICO score: “Two missed payments. You can go from prime to subprime in two months.” After that, it takes five years to get back to prime status, he added. “This whole system of how we decide who gets credit and who gets to decide, and then what we do when the mortgage defaults, is something built in the ’40s.”Institutional Owners and the Rental ShiftDobson also addressed the growing role of institutional landlords like Amherst. Despite public criticism that firms like his crowd out homeowners, he maintains they instead fill a void left by tighter credit and lower homebuilding. Amherst’s residents often have modest incomes and below-prime credit but aspire to the benefits of suburban homes—yards, schools, and community—even if they rent, not own.​ “We got involved simply because … the nation is not going to finance [our customers] to live in the home.”In conversation with Fortune, Dobson argued that Amherst’s rise fills a vacuum and his residents are not served by the current mortgage industry. He said many Amherst residents have credit scores around 650 and a small percentage — fewer than 10% — have inconsistent payment histories: “If that was a mortgage pool, it would be a disaster.” Dobson said the model is a needed adaptation to post-pandemic American realities: it finances and upgrades homes at scale and offers housing stability when the government and traditional lenders have retreated.As for solutions, Dobson told Lambert he was skeptical of quick fixes from Washington. He advocated for expanding credit access—potentially through innovative financing or careful relaxation of lending standards—but notes that such ideas can be “the fastest way to end a meeting with a politician.”In conversation with Fortune, Dobson looked out on the future for the economy, his residents and the pursuit of a good life. On the subject of artificial intelligence, he said he thinks its impact on jobs will be most acute for frontline and service professionals, which make up a large chunk of Amherst’s residents. Dobson told Fortune that his average new resident makes slightly over $100,000 (Amherst said the median annual income of new residents is
$108,000). And if these residents are working a job “pushing paper and part of the workflow process,” then they could be in trouble, he said.When asked about the recent election of Zohran Mamdani as mayor of New York, framed by The New York Times as “the revenge of the struggling yuppie,” making about $120,000 and struggling to afford the city, Dobson declined to comment, except to say that many people seem to feel like they’ve done what they were told “and then they didn’t get what they were promised.”",https://okcfox.com/news/nation-world/fact-check-team-will-trumps-50-year-mortgage-idea-solve-or-worsen-housing-affordability-delay-americans-underwater-financial-borrowed-homeowner,Americans,39.828175,-98.5795,46,okcfox.com

Some analysis suggests Austin is the city most impacted by the company's algorithmic system.Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty ImagesWhen the U.S. Department of Justice sued RealPage and six of the largest rental property landlords in the nation over alleged price fixing — illegal price gouging — it came to light that Austin was among the cities where the company’s property management software had been most used.Several of the companies the Justice Department sued along with RealPage manage tens of thousands of rental units in the city. The list includes GreyStar, Camden Property Trust, Cortland Management and Willow Bridge Property Co. Agreements they have with Richardson-based Realpage likely harmed competition and pushed up rental prices, the government said in court documents.AdvertisementArticle continues below this adA Washington Post analysis identified Austin as the city most impacted, with 46% of multifamily units being managed by landlords using RealPage’s artificial intelligence-driven system.FROM JANUARY: Texas-based landlords accused of price-fixing rents, DOJ lawsuit claimsThe company says both that study and another, which ranked Austin fifth among AI rent-pricing markets, were flawed. It said the studies’ authors didn’t have the company’s data and used faulty assumptions. It hasn’t released data to substantiate that.Statesman LogoWant more Statesman?Make us a Preferred Source on Google to see more of us when you search.Add Preferred SourceBut RealPage has been adamant its software has been maligned and misunderstood.AdvertisementArticle continues below this adRichardson-based RealPage says its system is misunderstood by attorneys, states and cities that say it’s responsible for keeping rents high. The U.S. has accused it of illegal price fixing.Lola Gomez/Tribune News Service“Unfortunately, much of the debate has been fueled by serious misrepresentations about how revenue management software actually works and the value it provides for both housing providers and renters,” Jennifer Bowcock, RealPage senior vice president of communications, said in an emailed response to questions. “Related legislative activity has been animated by biased political efforts to claim quick wins.” The suit and others targeting RealPage stem from use of the company’s AI-based revenue management software, which allows landlords to share information on rents, vacancies, and other nonpublic data with each other. The software can then suggest higher rents, helping landlords present a united front rather than competing for customers through concessions or lower rents, according to the Justice Department.The company’s software — which court documents show some executives called “classic price fixing” — was popular, gobbling up 80% of the market.  AdvertisementArticle continues below this adThe company set up a website to address the criticism it’s faced since the suit and others were filed. It says increases in rental prices are caused by an undersupply of housing units and inflation, not its software and analytics.Broader impactBut now RealPage, once the toast of corporate landlords, is facing public criticism, bans in some states and former clients that say they will help the Justice Department prosecute the software giant. Many landlords have settled other cases related to their use of the system for millions of dollars.The resolution of the federal case could impact Austin’s tight housing market and what residents pay for rent.AdvertisementArticle continues below this adThen-U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland speaks with reporters in August 2024 about an antitrust lawsuit against real estate software company RealPage.Mark Schiefelbein/Associated Press file photoLegal experts say it’s a bellwether case for future algorithmic price-gouging schemes in other industries, too. The use of similiar practices by hotels and health insurance providers has also been alleged. That means the outcome of the RealPage case could have wider impacts. “It’s very important,” said Bill Baer, former director of competition at the Federal Trade Commission and U.S. assistant attorney general over antitrust. “Hopefully it will return to consumers the benefit of real competition for rental apartments.”Last year the Biden Administration estimated the average additional cost to consumers of AI-price coordination was $70 per month of rent nationally, or $3.8 billion. In Dallas, it was estimated the system was costing renters $136 extra each month. It provided no specific estimate for Austin.AdvertisementArticle continues below this adBut Austin has long struggled with housing affordability. Price surges in the past decade made it one of the most costly cities to rent in. And only recently has it felt relief as rental prices fell the past two years. But it’s still nearly 17% higher than pre-pandemic levels, according to Zillow. “Lack of supply is the root cause of the housing affordability crisis,” RealPage stated on its website. In a statement they note Austin’s prices only fell when housing supply grew.What’s alleged?The Justice Department and 10 state’s attorneys general said in a 115-page civil court filing that RealPage software allowed the nation’s biggest landlords to share nonpublic data about vacancy rates, leasing prices and costs then made recommendations on how to maximize profits to the detriment of consumers. Rather than run promotions and drop prices to get customers, landlords using the software might keep apartments off the market, and prices up, or suggest higher rents in a coordinated effort.AdvertisementArticle continues below this adRealPage has denied it ever recommended keeping apartments off the market and maintains its product doesn’t break the law. RealPage collects information from its clients that lawsuits allege have kept rents high in cities including Austin.Ken Ellis/Houston Chronicle illustrationThe algorithmic-suggestions essentially took away all competition, the DOJ said, replacing the smoke-filled back rooms of old with digital databases and dashboards — and giving massive property owners plausible deniability, Baer said. “It gives the companies who submit data and get back recommended pricing … [the ability to say] ‘Well, I didn’t do it, The algorithm just did it. It’s just math. It’s not collusion,’ ” he said. “No, it’s using an algorithm to collude.”AdvertisementArticle continues below this adCortland Management settled with the government in January over its 80,000 units. Greystar, which owns and manages nearly a million units in the United States also settled  two months ago for $50 million. It said it wouldn’t share the sensitive, nonpublic data again or use such algorithms, and that it will help the government’s prosecution of RealPage. Companies that settled with the government are helping the government’s case, Baer said. “They have provided very incriminating evidence that this kind of collusion was intentional and was happening a whole lot,” he said. That isn’t the only bad news for the $10 billion company. Cities in multiple states have banned the use of AI-rent setting and 22 states have considered or are considering legislation banning software like RealPage. New York — the only state to have passed a law — signed it into effect last month.AdvertisementArticle continues below this adIn September, RealPage settled with the state of Nevada. It made no admission of wrongdoing and was able to continue using nonpublic data to generate rent recommendations as long as they were based on data that was three-months old and anonymized.The company is fighting back, too. It sued the city of Berkeley, Calif., over its ordinance banning the software, saying it was “prompted by an intentional campaign of misinformation and often-repeated false claims about the company’s revenue management software.”Austin rentsAustin rents have been declining for more than a year after an apartment building boom increased supply and drove down prices. But rents are still high enought that, according to a Harvard University study last year, more than half of the region’s renters are cost burdened — meaning they’re spending more than 30% of their income on housing. AdvertisementArticle continues below this adThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development estimated that the fair market rental rate for an efficiency in the Austin-Round Rock metropolitan statistical area in 2015 was $681. In 2025 it was $1,549 — an increase of 127%. According to the Justice’s Department’s complaint, RealPage is designed to keep rents artificially high regardless of market forces. Court documents imply markets like Austin that have seen some relief on rents, may have been more affordable without RealPage’s involvement. Quoted in court documents, RealPage information appears to support that assertion: “Our tool … ensures that [landlords] are driving every possible opportunity to increase price even in the most downward trending or unexpected conditions.”  K Agbebiyi, senior housing campaign coordinator at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, said its data shows that rents for the poorest residents have been affected more than those for other economic groups. AdvertisementArticle continues below this ad“It’s going to be the poorer tenants that are largely hit by these rent prices,” they said.Online tools allow would-be renters to search for aparements and rental rates.AndreyPopov/Getty ImagesBut Agdebiyi rejected the idea that simply banning RealPage would reverse rising housing prices. While the organization has said RealPage is harmful to the rental landscape, it agrees the company has been scapegoated. That’s because the issues of affordability go far beyond RealPage’s control, including the rise of private equity in rental markets, the project says. But RealPage is an easier target for people to understand, they said. “I think instead it’s easier for states to be like, ‘Oh, well, rent is really high because of this, like, boogie man,’ "" Agdebiyi said of cities and states that are going after the company.AdvertisementArticle continues below this adAI-fueled gougingRent rates are not the only costs for which AI-price gouging has been alleged. The Justice Department has said the use of algorithmic technologies used by competitors to coordinate decision making “poses a growing threat to the free market.”“It’s not limited to the rental housing market,” Baer, the former Justice Department official, said. “The fact is it may well be that this is just the tip of the iceberg.”  The department says, for example, that a company called MultiPlan Inc is using such tools to drive down the amount it reimburses health providers for services. It says hotels are doing it to drive up prices in Las Vegas. Researchers have found AI-collusion in the financial markets.

Councilmember Brooke Pinto introduced a sweeping package of 23 bills Monday morning aimed at expanding economic opportunities, improving youth development programs and supporting local businesses in the District.According to Pinto, the “Prosper DC Plan” builds on Pinto’s earlier public safety-focused initiatives — Peace DC and Secure DC — by addressing what she calls the economic and opportunity gaps that contribute to instability for many residents. The plan includes measures to improve job access, reduce barriers for entrepreneurs, expand youth programming and make housing more affordable.SEE ALSO | DC invests $9.2M in program monitoring students traveling to & from school""We must create pathways to economic prosperity for all District residents and entrepreneurs to ensure the District remains a place where people want to live, work, grow their business, and create communities that are vibrant.” said Councilmember Pinto. “As I have met with residents across the District, it is clear folks are eager to be part of lifting up the city -- creating pathways to contribute, earn, and grow must be central to the future we are fighting for together. My Prosper DC Plan will help uplift families, residents, and businesses by investing in economic opportunities for residents, competitiveness for businesses, positive youth development, and affordable, healthy, and accessible communities.” In weeks’ worth of council hearings and testimony, saying more resources are needed to prevent kids from getting into trouble and crime, Pinto said this is her answer.WJLASeven of the 23 bills in the package focus on juveniles and their development in the district. We asked Pinto why she thinks these bills are realistic and how they relate to reducing juvenile crime.“We have to do more to prevent and if somebody violates the law they have to be held accountable,” Pinto said “I've always believed that we can and must do both in our city, which is why every time we advance a specific tool or specific idea it is one in a holistic set of pathways that we have to move forward in.”The bills focused on juveniles do the following:Allows minors to open a deposit account without parental consentRequires D.C. schools to create appropriate AI use for students and staffCovers 50% of wages for employers who hire a young adult parent7News asked Pinto why employers get subsidies.“I'm a big believer in aligning incentives,” Pinto said. “We have a population in D.C. that is seeing increased rates of teen pregnancy and young people having children, and that often creates a lot of economic challenges for that family. And so, what we wanted to create with this bill was a pilot program to provide some subsidization to get access to employment.The bills also:Gives $300,000 to non-profits for social and educational programmingRequires the Deputy Mayor for Education to create an app that connects teens looking for jobs with hiring in all eight wards. Expands the Marion Barry youth program from 24 to 30 years old.The Department of Parks and Recreation would also be required to open and operate a teen center in each quadrant of the city.Pinto said she wants this to pass and be included in this year's budget. 7News asked if the D.C. budget could handle the enhancement after the budget crisis. Pinto said it's all about focusing the budget in the right place.""Bringing in these other aspects, this holistic approach to addressing juvenile crime, I think it makes a lot of sense as long as it’s not at the expense of public safety,"" Joshua Ederheimer, a former official with the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and current assistant professor at the University of Virginia, said. Ederheimer backs the program, howeverMy only concern when I saw this was: Is money going to be diverted from the police department to support these very good programs? I think that’s a very bad idea because the department is understaffed and they need the funding.The D.C. Police Union has said the department is short about 800 officers, out of a current 3,200, while the mayor says they need about 500. Enforcement, Ederheimer adds, is crucial to keeping a city safe, but it's far from the only answer. ""I think any funding for these well-thought-out programs needs to complement and be in addition to the police department budget,"" he said. According to a release, the Prosper DC Plan takes important steps to deliver:Economic Opportunities for ResidentsPositive Youth DevelopmentSupports and Attraction Incentives for BusinessesAffordable, Healthy and Accessible HousingSee the bills introduced below: Economic Opportunities for Residents:1.

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.Meanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.TrendingShooting at NC Christmas event leaves 3 critically injured, 3 suspects in custodyFour people were shot at around 7:30 p.m. on Union Street S near the intersection with Corban Avenue, where the event was taking place.Is there price-fixing in the beef industry?Beef prices aren't likely to move much after Tyson Foods announced the closure of one of its plants, according to an agricultural economist.BREAKING: 45 arrested after Newton County S.O. raids dogfighting ring A Newton County Sheriff's Office investigation led to a Saturday night raid of a dogfighting ring in the Call community off FM 1004 and the arrest of 45 people,Marsh fire near Cheniere LNG in SW Louisiana sends thick smoke into Port ArthurA significant marsh fire is currently burning across the highway from Cheniere, Louisiana, sending a substantial amount of smoke toward Port Arthur.Local authoExperts share tips for enjoying a heart-healthy Thanksgiving without sacrificing traditionStruggle with making your food heart-healthy?

Charlotte to Host Inaugural Housing Innovation Challenge to Tackle the National Affordability Crisis

ACCESS Newswire
18 Nov 2025, 20:20 GMT+10

CHARLOTTE, NC / ACCESS Newswire / November 18, 2025 / The Housing Innovation Alliance, in partnership with the City of Charlotte, Meritage Homes and Home Technology Ventures, is calling on leading housing innovators to reimagine how America designs and delivers the next generation of homes.

The Housing Innovation Challenge (Challenge) is uniting students, builders, and innovators to deliver new housing solutions. It's not just another competition, it's a national call to action - an invitation to roll up our sleeves and tackle one of the greatest challenges of our time: making quality housing more attainable.

Reducing the Total Cost of Housing

People are priced out of the dream of homeownership. Nearly 75% of households across the country are unable to afford the median-priced new home and more than 50% of Gen Z renters believe winning the lottery is their only ticket to buying their first home.

Construction costs keep rising. Productivity and innovation haven't kept pace. Traditional methods can't deliver the speed or affordability needed to solve this growing problem. This Challenge aims to change that; bringing together the best minds in design, engineering, construction, technology, and business to rethink the entire process of how homes are designed, built and utilized for long-term value. Building on the 20-year legacy of the U.S. Department of Energy's Solar Decathlon, the Challenge expands the conversation from energy performance to total cost of housing - focusing beyond what price the home can be delivered to include its cost of maintenance, utilities, insurance and the other hidden, growing costs of homes.

Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles praised the initiative,'We are proud to host the Housing Innovation Challenge. Affordable housing is a critical area of investment that remains a priority for the City of Charlotte. This competition has a meaningful purpose which is to create more affordable housing not just in our city, but in every city across the country. The Challenge shines a spotlight on the incredible talent we have right here in Charlotte and across the Carolinas - architects, engineers, builders, and entrepreneurs who can lead the nation in housing innovation.

The Competition

The Challenge is a two-phase design and build competition open to universities, colleges, and vocational schools across North America. Through the Housing Innovation Alliance's national network, the teams will partner with industry veterans to operationalize their ideas and introduce the next generation of housing solutions.

Phase 1: Design + Planning (December 2025 - May 2026)

Phase 1 pushes teams to rethink housing industry norms - advancing conceptual and schematic designs that explore new approaches to design, materials, systems, construction, and long-term performance. 'This first phase is about bold ideas,' says Bobby Vance, Competition Co-Director and Assistant Professor at Virginia Tech. 'We want proposals that challenge entrenched norms, demonstrate innovation in industrialized or hybrid off-site construction, and show how homes can be built faster, more affordably, and with lower future operating costs.'

Working within (while also challenging) existing Charlotte zoning parameters and affordability targets for households earning ≤ 80% AMI, teams may submit up to three design proposals, each envisioning a home that is beautiful, attainable, and replicable. Land is provided, allowing each proposal to focus on optimizing construction cost and long term operational performance.

All submissions are due March 20, 2026, and will be evaluated through the H.O.M.E. Framework - a proprietary framework for a holistic view of affordability contemplating the costs of Home Delivery, Occupancy, Maintenance, and the benefits of increased Equity - by a committee of national experts, industry leaders, and City of Charlotte partners.

Up to ten Finalist teams will be selected to move on to Phase 2. Each Finalist will receive $10,000 in travel support and be invited to the Housing Innovation Summit in Charlotte (May 19-21, 2026), where they will be officially announced to the public.

Phase 2: Build + Showcase (May 2026 - October 2027)

In Phase 2, the finalist teams transition from concept to construction, working hand-in-hand with leading national builders and industry partners to transform their schematic ideas into full-scale homes built in Charlotte. Each home will be delivered using an industrialized approach incorporating off-site construction methods where possible, emphasizing speed, precision, and cost-effectiveness.

Academic teams will continue to lead design development and actively participate in the fabrication and assembly, contributing labor, documentation, and technical coordination to gain hands-on experience throughout the project. Build partners and material sponsors will provide expertise, construction leadership, and product support to ensure every home reflects the Challenge's core goals.

Homes will be built ahead of the October 2027 public exhibition, when Charlotte will host the inaugural Housing Innovation Challenge showcase. 'This is where it gets really exciting. During the exhibition period, these homes will serve as living laboratories - open for public tours, industry workshops, research activities, and policy discussions. This is a unique opportunity for the teams to see their work in the wild,' emphasized Challenge Co-Director and industry competition veteran Richard King. Following the Challenge, each home is intended for delivery to local residents, leaving a permanent affordability legacy in Charlotte while forming the foundation for a national catalog of replicable, industrialized housing solutions.

Building a National Ecosystem for Change

This initiative is a catalyst for systemic transformation in housing. Dennis Steigerwalt, President of the Housing Innovation Alliance, underscores the foundation of this effort, 'Participating teams are decoding signals at the intersection of lifestyle aspirations and economic realities shaping today's housing market. These insights will inform actionable strategies to enhance housing performance, elevate consumer value, and strengthen margins across the value chain.'

Industry leaders echo that sentiment, emphasizing the human impact behind the work. Brett Welch, Senior Director of Building Science and Innovation at Meritage Homes, frames the Challenge as an investment in people: 'We believe every family deserves to live better, at a price they can afford,' Welch said. 'The Challenge gives us a chance to engage people with new ideas and empower students and tradespeople to redefine how homes are made.'

Join the Challenge

Whether you're a student, builder, manufacturer, or community partner, you can play a role in the Challenge.

'I'm calling on city leaders, state partners, and local industry to rise to the occasion - to support our students, sponsor our teams, and help us build a future where every individual and family can afford a place to call home,' added Mayor Lyles.

That spirit of collaboration and innovation resonates with Chris Langford, Managing Partner of Home Technology Ventures, who sees Charlotte as the ideal stage for this national conversation: 'Innovation is an important part of the solution to the housing crisis today,' said Langford. 'As a Charlottean and one of the original investors in housing-related innovation, I am incredibly proud to bring this Challenge to the city and, further, to the benefit of the country as a whole. This is a groundbreaking catalyst for showcasing what the best and brightest minds can accomplish when focused on the biggest issue of our time.'

Charlotte to Host Inaugural Housing Innovation Challenge to Tackle the National Affordability Crisis

ACCESS Newswire
18 Nov 2025, 20:20 GMT+10

CHARLOTTE, NC / ACCESS Newswire / November 18, 2025 / The Housing Innovation Alliance, in partnership with the City of Charlotte, Meritage Homes and Home Technology Ventures, is calling on leading housing innovators to reimagine how America designs and delivers the next generation of homes.

The Housing Innovation Challenge (Challenge) is uniting students, builders, and innovators to deliver new housing solutions. It's not just another competition, it's a national call to action - an invitation to roll up our sleeves and tackle one of the greatest challenges of our time: making quality housing more attainable.

Reducing the Total Cost of Housing

People are priced out of the dream of homeownership. Nearly 75% of households across the country are unable to afford the median-priced new home and more than 50% of Gen Z renters believe winning the lottery is their only ticket to buying their first home.

Construction costs keep rising. Productivity and innovation haven't kept pace. Traditional methods can't deliver the speed or affordability needed to solve this growing problem. This Challenge aims to change that; bringing together the best minds in design, engineering, construction, technology, and business to rethink the entire process of how homes are designed, built and utilized for long-term value. Building on the 20-year legacy of the U.S. Department of Energy's Solar Decathlon, the Challenge expands the conversation from energy performance to total cost of housing - focusing beyond what price the home can be delivered to include its cost of maintenance, utilities, insurance and the other hidden, growing costs of homes.

Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles praised the initiative,'We are proud to host the Housing Innovation Challenge. Affordable housing is a critical area of investment that remains a priority for the City of Charlotte. This competition has a meaningful purpose which is to create more affordable housing not just in our city, but in every city across the country. The Challenge shines a spotlight on the incredible talent we have right here in Charlotte and across the Carolinas - architects, engineers, builders, and entrepreneurs who can lead the nation in housing innovation.

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.Meanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.TrendingCrash victim hit, killed while stepping out of vehicle to investigateA person who left their car after crashing on the Northway was hit and killed.State police say it happened just before 8:15 Sunday evening just south of Exit 11Woman who caused deadly crash while off seizure meds sentenced to prisonA woman who caused a deadly crash while off anti-seizure medication has been sentenced to 1⅓ to four years in prison.Indictment unsealed in the murder of veteran Daniel Frament; suspect pleads not guiltyAn indictment has been unsealed in the homicide investigation surrounding the death of Daniel Frament, the veteran who was killed on the Menands bike trail.Firefighters rescue woman trapped in submerged SUV in Skidmore College pondFirefighters rescued a woman whose vehicle became submerged in a pond on the Skidmore College campus Sunday afternoon.According to Saratoga Springs Fire Dept.

Charlotte to Host Inaugural Housing Innovation Challenge to Tackle the National Affordability Crisis 
ACCESS Newswire 
18 Nov 2025, 20:20 GMT+10  

CHARLOTTE, NC / ACCESS Newswire / November 18, 2025 / The Housing Innovation Alliance, in partnership with the City of Charlotte, Meritage Homes and Home Technology Ventures, is calling on leading housing innovators to reimagine how America designs and delivers the next generation of homes.
The Housing Innovation Challenge (Challenge) is uniting students, builders, and innovators to deliver new housing solutions. It's not just another competition, it's a national call to action - an invitation to roll up our sleeves and tackle one of the greatest challenges of our time: making quality housing more attainable.
Reducing the Total Cost of Housing
People are priced out of the dream of homeownership. Nearly 75% of households across the country are unable to afford the median-priced new home and more than 50% of Gen Z renters believe winning the lottery is their only ticket to buying their first home.
Construction costs keep rising. Productivity and innovation haven't kept pace. Traditional methods can't deliver the speed or affordability needed to solve this growing problem. This Challenge aims to change that; bringing together the best minds in design, engineering, construction, technology, and business to rethink the entire process of how homes are designed, built and utilized for long-term value. Building on the 20-year legacy of the U.S. Department of Energy's Solar Decathlon, the Challenge expands the conversation from energy performance to total cost of housing - focusing beyond what price the home can be delivered to include its cost of maintenance, utilities, insurance and the other hidden, growing costs of homes.
Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles praised the initiative,'We are proud to host the Housing Innovation Challenge. Affordable housing is a critical area of investment that remains a priority for the City of Charlotte. This competition has a meaningful purpose which is to create more affordable housing not just in our city, but in every city across the country. The Challenge shines a spotlight on the incredible talent we have right here in Charlotte and across the Carolinas - architects, engineers, builders, and entrepreneurs who can lead the nation in housing innovation.
The Competition
The Challenge is a two-phase design and build competition open to universities, colleges, and vocational schools across North America. Through the Housing Innovation Alliance's national network, the teams will partner with industry veterans to operationalize their ideas and introduce the next generation of housing solutions.
Phase 1: Design + Planning (December 2025 - May 2026)
Phase 1 pushes teams to rethink housing industry norms - advancing conceptual and schematic designs that explore new approaches to design, materials, systems, construction, and long-term performance. 'This first phase is about bold ideas,' says Bobby Vance, Competition Co-Director and Assistant Professor at Virginia Tech. 'We want proposals that challenge entrenched norms, demonstrate innovation in industrialized or hybrid off-site construction, and show how homes can be built faster, more affordably, and with lower future operating costs.'
Working within (while also challenging) existing Charlotte zoning parameters and affordability targets for households earning ≤ 80% AMI, teams may submit up to three design proposals, each envisioning a home that is beautiful, attainable, and replicable. Land is provided, allowing each proposal to focus on optimizing construction cost and long term operational performance.
All submissions are due March 20, 2026, and will be evaluated through the H.O.M.E. Framework - a proprietary framework for a holistic view of affordability contemplating the costs of Home Delivery, Occupancy, Maintenance, and the benefits of increased Equity - by a committee of national experts, industry leaders, and City of Charlotte partners.
Up to ten Finalist teams will be selected to move on to Phase 2. Each Finalist will receive $10,000 in travel support and be invited to the Housing Innovation Summit in Charlotte (May 19-21, 2026), where they will be officially announced to the public.
Phase 2: Build + Showcase (May 2026 - October 2027)
In Phase 2, the finalist teams transition from concept to construction, working hand-in-hand with leading national builders and industry partners to transform their schematic ideas into full-scale homes built in Charlotte. Each home will be delivered using an industrialized approach incorporating off-site construction methods where possible, emphasizing speed, precision, and cost-effectiveness.
Academic teams will continue to lead design development and actively participate in the fabrication and assembly, contributing labor, documentation, and technical coordination to gain hands-on experience throughout the project. Build partners and material sponsors will provide expertise, construction leadership, and product support to ensure every home reflects the Challenge's core goals.
Homes will be built ahead of the October 2027 public exhibition, when Charlotte will host the inaugural Housing Innovation Challenge showcase. 'This is where it gets really exciting. During the exhibition period, these homes will serve as living laboratories - open for public tours, industry workshops, research activities, and policy discussions. This is a unique opportunity for the teams to see their work in the wild,' emphasized Challenge Co-Director and industry competition veteran Richard King. Following the Challenge, each home is intended for delivery to local residents, leaving a permanent affordability legacy in Charlotte while forming the foundation for a national catalog of replicable, industrialized housing solutions.
Building a National Ecosystem for Change
This initiative is a catalyst for systemic transformation in housing. Dennis Steigerwalt, President of the Housing Innovation Alliance, underscores the foundation of this effort, 'Participating teams are decoding signals at the intersection of lifestyle aspirations and economic realities shaping today's housing market. These insights will inform actionable strategies to enhance housing performance, elevate consumer value, and strengthen margins across the value chain.'
Industry leaders echo that sentiment, emphasizing the human impact behind the work. Brett Welch, Senior Director of Building Science and Innovation at Meritage Homes, frames the Challenge as an investment in people: 'We believe every family deserves to live better, at a price they can afford,' Welch said. 'The Challenge gives us a chance to engage people with new ideas and empower students and tradespeople to redefine how homes are made.'
Join the Challenge
Whether you're a student, builder, manufacturer, or community partner, you can play a role in the Challenge.
'I'm calling on city leaders, state partners, and local industry to rise to the occasion - to support our students, sponsor our teams, and help us build a future where every individual and family can afford a place to call home,' added Mayor Lyles.
That spirit of collaboration and innovation resonates with Chris Langford, Managing Partner of Home Technology Ventures, who sees Charlotte as the ideal stage for this national conversation: 'Innovation is an important part of the solution to the housing crisis today,' said Langford. 'As a Charlottean and one of the original investors in housing-related innovation, I am incredibly proud to bring this Challenge to the city and, further, to the benefit of the country as a whole. This is a groundbreaking catalyst for showcasing what the best and brightest minds can accomplish when focused on the biggest issue of our time.'

Manufactured housing is expanding nationwide, led by Sunbelt states. Florida has the largest inventory, while New Mexico leads by share. Cities like Mesa and Largo show strong concentrations. With average costs near $123,000, manufactured homes offer rare affordability. Despite zoning hurdles, modern designs and rising demand are accelerating adoption across diverse markets.  AI Summary

Manufactured housing continues to widen its reach, led by the Sunbelt, where warm climates, flexible zoning and lower land costs make factory-built homes a durable affordability option.

Nationally, about 7.9 million manufactured units account for 5.4% of all housing, according to a new study from Storage Cafe.

2025-11-19 01:45:00,"Many of us remember the episode of The Office in which Michael Scott plans to purchase a new house. He excitedly gives Dwight a tour and fantasizes about his future there, until he realizes that the mortgage contract he is about to sign has a 30-year term. Michael immediately panics and starts finding issues with the house.What Michael’s real estate agent fails to explain is that the vast majority of home buyers don’t keep the same 30-year mortgage from start to finish. In fact, the average 30-year loan only lasts around 7–12 years, since people move and sell their homes, refinance with a new mortgage or pay it off early.
So why don’t mortgages have 7-12 year terms? Because most people can’t afford them.
The 30-year mortgage was created during the New Deal to replace much shorter, unaffordable loans that most buyers couldn’t sustain. It expanded access to homeownership at a time when the major barrier was the structure of mortgages themselves.
The 50-year mortgage idea recently floated by the Trump administration grows out of the same motivation of the 30-year mortgage of the 1930s—to make home ownership more accessible to people who would otherwise be renters.
But today, the main barrier is not how we finance homes—it’s that we don’t build enough of them.
Like the 30-year mortgage, the 50-year mortgage, if implemented, would almost never actually be held for 50 years. The real issue is that this proposal attempts to solve a supply-side problem with a demand-side solution. Longer mortgage terms treat the symptom—high monthly payments—but not the cause, which is an under supply of housing.
That problem isn’t going to be solved by a 30-year, 50-year or 100-year mortgage.
In fact, 50-year mortgages will further increase housing prices. Why? Because as terms lengthen, monthly payments will fall—allowing buyers to qualify for larger loans. These buyers can then bid more for the same limited number of homes.
So, what’s the solution to the housing supply problem? We need to make it simpler to build.
Georgia illustrates the problem clearly. The state has added more than a million new residents each decade, but construction has lagged behind. A recent analysis found that 94 of Georgia’s 159 counties now face a housing shortage.
Why aren’t we building enough?
One major reason is increased regulation, which results in delays and uncertainty in the permitting process. Builders can only break ground when a building permit is issued, which is after zoning and land-use decisions have been made. When those permits are slow or unpredictable, each month of delay adds carrying costs for land, labor and financing; those costs are eventually baked into the sale price. Regulatory costs now account for roughly 27% of the price of a new home.
Permit reform would be far more impactful than a 50-year mortgage. Luckily, the state is already looking into this. Proposed legislation would require local governments to approve or deny a building permit within 45 days. If a permit is denied and the builder fixes the issues and resubmits, the local government would have 14 days to respond and any denial would have to include a written explanation citing the specific rules behind it. These guardrails don’t weaken safety or quality standards; they simply make the process timely and predictable so builders know what to expect.
We also know this kind of reform works.
Arizona recently adopted a similar “permit freedom” policy. There, the average time to close out a residential building permit fell from about 200 days in 2022 to 126 days in 2024. Analysts at Common Sense Institute Arizona estimate that this change alone will allow roughly 3,800 additional homes to be built each year and could reduce housing prices by as much as 5%.
Streamlining permits and trimming unnecessary fees would do more to help first-time buyers than tacking 20 extra years onto their mortgage. The goal is not to maximize the amount of debt a household can carry; it is to make it possible for more families to buy reasonably priced homes in the first place.
Michael Scott’s panic was played for laughs, but his reaction is understandable. The mortgage is one of the most visible parts of the home-buying process, so it’s easy to assume that changing the loan is the key to affordability. But as the data show, if policymakers want to help people become homeowners, they should spend less time dreaming up longer mortgage terms and more time making it faster, cheaper and simpler to build the homes Americans need.",https://kmph.com/news/nation-world/fact-check-team-will-trumps-50-year-mortgage-idea-solve-or-worsen-housing-affordability-delay-americans-underwater-financial-borrowed-homeowner,"New York, United States",42.1497,-74.9384,46,kmph.com

How Housing Affordability Is Polarizing Voters
Americans are growing more divided by the lack of affordability in the housing market. Research shows homeowners are more likely to align with right-wing politics, while renters are more likely to align with the left
Nov. 18, 2025
2 min read

Housing affordability has become an increasingly polarizing issue, with renters now more likely to align with the left and homeowners now more likely to align with the right. 

Housing affordability has challenged Americans for several decades, but what's new is how polarizing it has become across the political landscape. According to Home Economics, a provider of real estate insights and data, renters are increasingly on the left side of the political spectrum, while homeowners are now more likely to align with the right.

This trend can be observed in the campaigns and ideologies of current politicians. Recently elected New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, for instance, ran his campaign on affordability for renters. Meanwhile, the Trump administration recently proposed a 50-year mortgage as a way to lower monthly housing payments. While both plans focus on affordability, each appeals to their respective bases.

There is no filter—education, race, or religion—that comes close to showing the 14-point ideological split we see between renters and owners.

Renters are more left-leaning across the income spectrum, across ages, and in all but 7 states. So it makes complete sense for Mamdani to champion renters and challenge NIMBYism, while Trump focuses on easier homeownership financing.

This is a political hot potato and we’re wary of putting our thumbs on the scale. But our view—formed through countless analyses and grounded in academic literatured—is that unequal access to housing primarily reflects unequal incomes.

Proposed solutions that sidestep this reality—freezing the rent, boosting supply, improving construction productivity, or extending mortgage terms—will merely keep affordability at the top of the agenda, and certainly won’t overcome the force of income inequality that’s been gaining strength since Darwin observed a housing crisis in 1836.

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.Meanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.TrendingIllinois State Police investigating deadly plane crash in Pike CountyOne person is dead after a plane crash in Pike County Sunday night.1 adult, 3 young children injured when SUV goes airborne, crashes in northeast MissouriFour northeast Missouri residents, including an infant, were hurt in a weekend crash in Marion County.The one-vehicle crash happened at noon on Saturday on MariPepsi-Cola Memphis Bottling Company gets new name, new ownersA beverage company that's been in northeast Missouri for 96 years is now under new ownership.In early November 2025, Pepsi-Cola Memphis Bottling Company in MempHy-Vee closed for Thanksgiving for fourth straight yearA Tri-State grocery store chain will be closed for Thanksgiving once again this year.USPS holiday shipping deadlines for 2025 have been releasedThanksgiving is on Thursday.Once that is over, people will be rushing to get gifts sent to loved ones.NEWS IN PHOTOS:""Local""5Pepsi-Cola Memphis Bottling Company gets new name, new owners4Illinois State Police investigating deadly plane crash in Pike County3Camp Point embraces holiday spirit with unique ceramics at Windsong Acres' Christmas event3Quincy Service League hosts 57th annual Holiday Gift Show at Oakley-Lindsay CenterACCESSIBILITYDownload Our Mobile Apps:Terms & ConditionsCopyright NoticesEEO Public File ReportFCC InfoFCC ApplicationsPublic File AssistanceContactNews TeamCareersContestsNewsWeatherSportsScheduleMobile AlertsOne Class at a TimeHometown HeroesSchool ClosingsKHQA AppsGame CenterPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyDo Not Sell or ShareCookie Preferencestwitter iconfacebook icon 2025 Sinclair, Inc.",https://wwmt.com/news/nation-world/fact-check-team-will-trumps-50-year-mortgage-idea-solve-or-worsen-housing-affordability-delay-americans-underwater-financial-borrowed-homeowner,"Washington, Washington, United States",38.8951,-77.0364,1,wwmt.com

WASHINGTON (TNND) — The Federal Reserve signaled this week that aspiring home buyers expecting more interest-rate relief may have to keep waiting. And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.

It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.

How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater Mortgages

Being “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.

But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.

Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:

27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.
18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.
10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.

The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.

When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.

What Happens When You’re Underwater?

For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.

You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.
You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.
The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.
It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.

In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.

Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?

Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.

Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”

The Upside: Lower Payments

Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)

A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.

A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.

Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.

The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger Risks

There would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example:

30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,000
50-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000

You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.

The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.

The Bottom Line

Builder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.Meanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.TrendingParents arrested for second-degree murder after toddler killed in dog attack at OKC homeThe parents of a 2-year-old girl were arrested on Friday after the child was killed in a dog attack, according to Oklahoma City Police.Police arrest suspect in Tulsa pharmacy break-in; Fireball bottle trail leads to himA late-night break-in at a south Tulsa pharmacy ended with an arrest after officers followed a trail that included miniature bottles of Fireball whiskey.Tulsa pOHP: Tulsa man killed in possible DUI crashA Tulsa man was killed in a crash in which he may have been driving under the influence, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol said.Teen going 100 mph charged with killing pregnant girlfriend in deadly 12-vehicle crashA teenager, Jose Gutierrez, 19, is facing murder charges after allegedly causing a 12-vehicle crash while driving at 100 mph in a 45 mph zone.Gynecologist who worked at multiple hospitals accused of recording, touching 50 patientsA gynecologist who worked at multiple hospitals was accused by over 50 patients of secretly recording and inappropriately touching them.NEWS IN PHOTOS:""Local""11A look at the accomplishments of Mother Viola Fletcher 4Parents arrested for second-degree murder after toddler killed in dog attack at OKC home5Police arrest suspect in Tulsa pharmacy break-in; Fireball bottle trail leads to him6Thunder's Holmgren treats foster families to Thanksgiving dinnerACCESSIBILITYDownload Our Mobile Apps:Terms & ConditionsCopyright NoticesEEO Public File ReportFCC InfoFCC ApplicationsPublic File AssistanceContactNews TeamCareersContestsNewsWeatherSportsGame CenterPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyDo Not Sell or ShareCookie Preferencestwitter iconfacebook icon 2025 Sinclair, Inc.",https://ktul.com/news/nation-world/fact-check-team-will-trumps-50-year-mortgage-idea-solve-or-worsen-housing-affordability-delay-americans-underwater-financial-borrowed-homeowner,"Washington, Washington, United States",38.8951,-77.0364,5,ktul.com

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk.

That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.Comment with BubblesBE THE FIRST TO COMMENTMeanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.TrendingErika Kirk opens up about wishing for pregnancy after husband's tragic assassinationKirk joined Megyn Kelly for a live interview on the last stop of Kelly's Sirius XM tour in Glendale, Arizona.

Mortgage-rate dip lifts housing affordability to a 3-year high

Thanksgiving may mean eating turkey sandwiches on cardboard-box tables for plenty of home buyers this year. Buyers and sellers defied seasonal cooling patterns to turn in the strongest October housing market in three years, according to the latest market report1 from Zillow®. Improved housing affordability  helped drive a rare fall surge in sellers both listing their homes and accepting offers from buyers; both metrics are up 5% year over year to levels not seen in October since 2022, and both stayed flat from September instead of ticking down, as they typically do this time of year.

“Buyers and sellers both got some badly needed relief to perk up what is typically a shoulder season for the housing market. The reaction to lower rates shows that buyers are ready to make offers when affordability improves,” said Kara Ng, Zillow senior economist. “While fall has been a sneaky good market for buyers and sellers who stuck it out past the busy season, winter is coming, and it may bring rate volatility with it. This warm-up is not guaranteed to last.”  

The average 30-year mortgage rate eased to 6.25%, reaching the lowest monthly average2 in more than a year. Home values stayed steady from last year, with the typical U.S. home value up 0.1% from last October to $362,117, according to the Zillow Home Value Index. Together those factors reduced mortgage payments by 1.8% compared to last October.3 

Paired with rising incomes, this has improved affordability for new home buyers to three-year highs — though costs are still a significant challenge. The median-earning household would spend 32.9% of its income on a mortgage on the typical home, given a 20% down payment. That’s the smallest share of income needed since August 2022. However, it’s still higher than the 30% threshold at which housing is considered a financial burden, and a 20% down payment is a serious hurdle at more than $72,000. 

More sellers test the market ahead of the holidays

Sellers reemerged in October after a sluggish summer, taking advantage of stronger demand and enjoying increased affordability themselves if they purchased another home. New listings picked up most compared to last year in Tampa, Raleigh, Orlando, Columbus, Louisville and Indianapolis.

Total inventory has risen 12.8% since last year and is 17.3% lower than 2018–2019 averages for this time of year. This is the smallest supply deficit since the pandemic began in March 2020 and a vast improvement over the 51% shortfall seen in February 2022, when the supply shortfall was largest.

Housing affordability improves as buyers seize lower rates

Buyers also responded quickly to the rate reprieve and improved ousing affordability. Newly pending listings fell just 0.1% from September, but climbed 5% from a year earlier, signaling resilience in a month when demand typically tapers off.

The sharpest increases in newly pending sales were seen in Tampa, Boston, Orlando, Jacksonville and Miami, where activity rebounded from last year’s unusually slow conditions and “snowbird” demand likely provided a boost.

Competition cools, bringing buyers markets to new frontiers

Zillow’s Market Heat Index shows competition among buyers is easing along seasonal lines and is far cooler than in past years. 

The market is balanced on the national scale, but 19 major markets now favor buyers, three more markets than in September and up from nine last October. These are concentrated in the South, but cold weather and accumulating inventory are bringing them farther north and west; new additions in October were Cincinnati, Milwaukee and Birmingham.

Sellers retain the strongest edge in Hartford, San Francisco, New York, San Jose and Providence, while Miami, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh and New Orleans rank among the country’s strongest buyers markets.

(TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk.

2025-11-15 13:15:00,"The Housing Affordability Crisis Is Accelerating Fastest in Rural America
Rural homebuyers need to earn $75,000 to afford the typical home, up from $36,000 before the pandemic.
The median home sale price in rural areas is up 61% from before the pandemic, compared with a 49% increase in suburban areas and a 46% gain in urban areas.
The median household income in rural areas has climbed 33%, less than the 37% increase in suburban areas and the 39% uptick in urban areas.

Homebuyers need to earn an annual income of $74,508 to afford the median-priced home in rural U.S. counties. That’s up 105.8% from before the pandemic, when rural buyers needed to earn $36,206, according to a new report from Redfin, the real estate brokerage powered by Rocket.
By comparison, the income needed to afford a home in suburban counties has risen 90.9% (to $102,120 from $53,482), and the income needed to afford a home in urban counties has climbed 87.5% (to $118,300 from $63,103). Rural America has been hit by a one-two punch of rising home prices and lagging incomes, and as a result has seen housing affordability erode faster than big cities and suburbs.
This is based on a Redfin analysis that compares the third quarter of 2025 with the third quarter of 2019. Redfin considers a home affordable if a buyer taking out a mortgage spends no more than 30% of their income on their monthly housing payment. The analysis uses MLS median home sale price data, prevailing mortgage rates and property-tax payments, and U.S. Census Bureau data on incomes.
Homebuyers in rural areas have faced relatively large jumps in home prices, which is one reason affordability has eroded. The median sale price in rural counties is $280,900, up 60.5% from $175,000 before the pandemic. By comparison, suburban counties have seen a 48.9% increase (to $385,000 from $258,500) and urban counties have experienced a 46.2% gain (to $446,000 from $305,000).
Income growth also hasn’t kept up. The median household income in rural counties is $69,307, up 33.3% from $52,002 before the pandemic. By comparison, suburban counties have seen a 36.8% gain (to $88,627 from $64,782) and urban counties have seen a 39.3% gain (to $89,784 from $64,468).
Big cities fell out of favor during the pandemic, when scores of Americans moved to rural and suburban areas in search of space, privacy and access to nature. Some were seeking a lower cost of living, while others were buying up pricey vacation homes in places like Lake Tahoe. Record-low mortgage rates and remote work were the forces that empowered millions to relocate. The pandemic homebuying frenzy that swept through rural and suburban areas sent home prices soaring, leaving many communities grappling with an affordability crisis that persists today. Rural areas often only have a handful of homes for sale, meaning homebuyers frequently compete with one another—another factor that drives up prices.
“During the pandemic, many buyers came to New Hampshire from out of state—places like New York, Texas, California, and Seattle. They often had larger budgets than locals and were able to pay above the asking price, which helped them win bidding wars and purchase properties in the Lakes Region,” said Julia Martinage, a Redfin Premier real estate agent in New Hampshire. “A lot of those people are now moving back to where they came from and being replaced by locals or people from border states like Massachusetts. I’m seeing a lot of young couples and families moving to rural areas from cities like Nashua and Manchester. They want land, chickens, quiet—a better quality of life.”
Rural Areas Continue to Attract Homebuyers Because They Remain Relatively Affordable
While rural areas have seen the fastest uptick in home prices in recent years, they remain affordable compared to many suburban and urban areas—one reason people continue to move to rural America.
A household on the median income in rural counties would need to spend 32.3% of their earnings on housing to buy the median-priced home. While that’s up from 20.9% before the pandemic, it remains lower than the share in suburban and urban areas. In suburban counties, a household on the median income would need to spend 34.6% of their income to buy the typical home, and in urban counties, it would need to spend 39.5%.
A rule of thumb in personal finance is to spend no more than 30% of income on housing, but that has become less realistic as housing costs have climbed.
“Rural America isn’t as affordable as it once was, but the silver lining is that unlike many urban areas, there’s still room to build homes,” said Redfin Senior Economist Asad Khan. “Adding more housing can ease the affordability crunch and also make room for more people, which can boost local economies.”
Governments in some states are actively seeking to combat the rural housing shortage through building. New York, for example, just invested $50 million in a program that will build manufactured housing, which is typically cheaper and quicker to construct.
New Hampshire Has Seen the Biggest Increase in Income Needed to Afford a Rural Home
Homebuyers need to earn an annual income of $119,361 to afford the median-priced home in rural New Hampshire. That’s up 141.4% from before the pandemic—a bigger increase than rural areas in any other state Redfin analyzed. It’s followed by neighboring Vermont and Maine, which saw respective increases of 139.2% and 137.3%.
These states top the list because they’ve seen the largest increases in home prices. The median rural home sale price in New Hampshire is up 88.3% from before the pandemic—a bigger increase than any other state Redfin analyzed. Next came Vermont and Maine, with respective increases of 86.6% and 85.1%.

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.Meanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.TrendingElection recount confirms Wintersville Council results, maintains election integrityThe final steps in the Ohio general election concluded on Monday morning in Jefferson County with a recount and audit of the election results from the general eBrooke High cheerleaders win 15th state championship titleThe Brooke High School cheerleading squad has secured its fifteenth state championship title by winning the 2025 Class AAA State Championship in Charleston, WesSteubenville Nutcracker Village returns with 230 displays for holiday seasonThe Steubenville Nutcracker Village has officially returned for the holiday season, showcasing 230 life-size nutcrackers throughout downtown Steubenville.

Housing Study Sees Affordability Gap As A Reality For Starter-Home Hopefuls
While housing construction is up and home prices have stabilized, researchers expect home buyers and renters will continue to face affordability headwinds in Massachusetts…
NOVEMBER 19, 2025
STATE HOUSE NEWS SERVICE

By Katie Castellani, State House News Service

While housing construction is up and home prices have stabilized, researchers expect home buyers and renters will continue to face affordability headwinds in Massachusetts. They note in a 108-page Greater Boston Housing Report Card 2025 released by The Boston Foundation and Boston Indicators on Nov. 12. that home prices and rents have flattened in 2025 but are still “historically” high.

“It’s easy to get lost in the numbers of units, permits, and cost burdens, but we must remind ourselves that at the end of the day, we are talking about real homes, families and communities,” Lee Pelton, CEO and president of the foundation, said in a statement.

While the gap between those who can afford to live in the Greater Boston area and those who can’t continues to widen, “these trends are not inevitable,” Pelton said during the event where the report was unveiled. “They reflect choices, policy choices, investment choices and collective priorities that we have the power to change,” he said.

The annual income a household needs to afford an “entry-level” home rose from about $98,000 in 2021 to more than $162,000 in 2025, assuming a 3.5 percent down payment, according to the report. This trend is squeezing renters out of making the leap to home ownership. Just 15 percent of renter households can afford an “entry-level” home – down from 30 percent in 2021.

“The data show just how much work we have to do if we are to expand opportunities and unfreeze the market,” Luc Schuster, executive director of Boston Indicators, TBF’s research arm, said in a statement.

Renters continue to face stiff prices.

The Greater Boston area has the fifth most expensive rental market in the country in 2025, according to the report, which cited the Zillow Observed Rent Index that tracks changes in market rents across housing types.

New York, San Jose, San Francisco and San Diego were the only four markets with higher rental prices than Boston. In September 2025, the ZORI found rent for the Boston area was almost $3,000 per month, not including other housing costs like heat, electricity, and water.

Rents across all neighborhoods within Boston metro core communities have risen since 2022, but increases slowed in some areas since 2024. Also, more than half of renters in Greater Boston are “cost-burdened,” meaning they spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing. More than one-quarter of renters spend more than 50 percent of their income on rent, meaning they are considered “severely cost-burdened.” Renters of color are cost burdened at higher levels, according to the report.

The report also noted that the rates of “cost-burdened” and “severely cost-burdened” may be overstated because the estimates – based on American Community Survey data – might inflate the cost burden for those in subsidized housing. Still, many in the region face affordability pressures.

A shortage of rental units in Boston is one of the main drivers for the city’s high rent prices. While vacancy rates across most major US cities have fallen in the past two decades, Boston’s was particularly low – just 3 percent in 2024. However, the report noted there are early indicators that vacancy rates may be rising in some neighborhoods with more students, likely because of a drop in international student enrollment under President Donald J. Trump’s immigration policies.

Census Address Counts, a dataset from the Census Bureau tracking a list of addresses, show that the Greater Boston area created more than 70,000 homes since 2020, marking a steady increase, according to the report.

But, the best available data on new construction permits, which are seen as a key indicator for future housing construction, have dropped. As of July 2025, the number of new permits issued are 44 percent below the levels for the same period in 2021. High construction costs and interest rates have made funding projects more difficult and are a key cause of the slowdown, especially when compounded with existing barriers like restrictive zoning, costly building code requirements, and lengthy approval processes, according to the report.

The study noted that declining permitting doesn’t bode well for Gov. Healey’s goal of constructing 220,000 additional homes in the state between 2025 and 2035. Since she took office in 2023, 90,400 homes have been “completed, started construction, or proposed,” according to the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities.

While it looks like the state is making progress on its goal, most of the 90,400 homes were built or permitted before 2025. If the pace of completions between 2023 and 2025 is kept up, Massachusetts would be on track to meet its goal of building 220,000 homes by 2035. But at the current pace of permitting, it’s unlikely the state will meet its goal.

Many of the homes recently completed were projects that were likely financed with “historically low” interest rates in the 2010s and 2020s, according to the report. Now, with more tariffs on building materials, workforce challenges and higher borrowing costs, getting projects financed is more difficult.

There are a lot of “intractable” challenges within government, but housing shouldn’t be one of them, said Lt. Gov. Kimberley Driscoll, during an event where the report was unveiled.

”It should not be as hard as it is,” she said, adding that it’s important for local and state officials as well as housing developers and communities to work together.

Homelessness hit record high levels in 2024 and dipped slightly in early 2025. However, the report noted that most recent available data was collected in January and may not reflect more recent shifts. Also, emergency assistance caseloads have dropped “dramatically” in 2025 – falling by almost half from January to July, according to the report, which said questions remain about whether those who exited shelters secured permanent housing or fell back into homelessness.

The report noted several moves by state leaders that contributed to this drop, including capping the shelter system to 4,000 families in July, a move that will take effect Dec. 31.  On Aug. 1, the governor also ended the state of emergency she declared in 2023 and closed all remaining hotel shelters.

The report also included a section with research by the Boston University Initiative on Cities on what communities have done to meet requirements outlined in the MBTA Communities Act. The section also includes a case study on how Lexington, Needham, and Wellesley responded to the law.

The act requires 177 cities and towns in the MBTA service area to change their zoning and land use policies to allow for construction of more housing – without requiring more housing to get built. The law has received a lot of media attention over controversy surrounding communities working on creating compliant plans.

Each community has had its own approach to complying with the law, and each faced many options. This year to date, the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities has approved plans for 106 municipalities. Another 56 communities are in conditional or interim compliance – meaning their processes are in progress or submissions are under review. Also, 15 communities with deadlines in July 2025 were not compliant as of Sept. 5. and 27 communities have deadlines in December, according to the report.

Driscoll said the law has been a “source of inspiration and at times a source of frustration.”

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost.

As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.Comment with BubblesJOIN THE CONVERSATION (5)Meanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.Trending51-year-old man arrested following attempted abduction at Traverse City Meijer parking lotGRAND TRAVERSE COUNTY, Mich,.

2025-11-14 22:15:00,"What brokers need to know about how young buyers differ from generations past
By
Matt Sexton
24 Nov 2025

While politicians continue wringing their hands and throwing things at the wall in an effort to address housing affordability challenges, younger borrowers are already thinking two steps ahead.
Since it doesn’t seem as if the government is going to help with the issue anytime soon, those looking for their first house are having to assess not just the impact of a mortgage payment, but also other expenses on their budgets.
According to the latest data collected by JD Power, young borrowers are concerned about how these large house payments will affect their way of life.
Bruce Gehrke (pictured top), senior director of wealth and lending intelligence at JD Power, said borrowers don’t believe the process is as easy as it used to be, largely due to the current market headwinds.
“You have the affordability challenges, you have the restricted supply out there, multiple offers, bidding wars, and things of that nature,” Gehrke told Mortgage Professional America. “Consumers have this perception going in that this wasn't as simple as it was once before, where you just kind of walk in, find the house you want, put down an offer, go back and forth, and you're ready to close.”
More complications
Buyers in the survey don’t perceive the mortgage process as easy as it once was, and they’re approaching a broker or originator with many more questions about how their finances will be affected.
“Now you have this perception that there are more complications involved,” Gehrke said. “I want to know more about the affordability issues. What can I afford? Not just what will I qualify for, but what fits into my lifestyle? And we see differences across demographics, especially among younger borrowers. They're not as willing, in some cases, to spend as much on housing relative to their income.”
Gehrke believes the younger generation of buyers has more places where their expendable income is going, compared to previous generations who might tighten discretionary spending in order to afford a home payment.
“So they're spending more money on other things, whether it's streaming services, whether it's Starbucks,” he said. “Where traditionally you go back a couple of generations, and people were eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for two years to afford a home, because that was a priority for them.”
Buyers want to know not only how a new mortgage payment fits into the budget, but also how the total costs of owning a home will affect them. Gehrke is seeing buyers showing regret because the actual financial impact of homeownership on the family budget may be more than they bargained for.
“Borrowers will say, ‘I want to have an understanding of this before I get down the line,’” Gehrke said. “Because one of the major points of regret that we see in first-time buyers is, ‘I didn't have a clear picture of all the costs involved in owning a home, and this is a lot more than I signed up for.’
“I think what you're seeing now is folks trying to nail that down before they go out there, so that they're looking in the price range and cost structure that they're comfortable with. It's not just ‘Get me prequalified,’ but ‘I could get that house, but I'm not comfortable living that way. I'd rather be in this price range, because it fits my lifestyle.’”
Advice for brokers
One encouraging aspect of this information is that it gives brokers a chance to leverage one of their biggest advantages: building one-on-one relationships with homebuyers. This allows the broker to craft a plan for all buyers, especially younger ones, that best fits their plans.
“From a broker perspective, I think they need to continue to focus on where their competitive advantage has always been,” he said. “I think that's more local, that's more personal, face-to-face with the borrower. I think that's still an advantage that they have.”
Michael Brennan, President of Nationwide Mortgage Bankers, urges originators to help homeowners leverage equity and manage consumer debt through proactive reviews and strike rate alerts.https://t.co/Htsu4BGceB
— Mortgage Professional America Magazine (@MPAMagazineUS) November 23, 2025
Gehrke also sees value in brokers partnering with bigger companies, like Rocket Pro and UWM, which can provide not only the technological backing that a smaller brokerage wouldn’t be able to afford on its own. They can also provide a funnel for leads, helping even the smallest brokers stay busy.
“I think that the key part for them is to find partners to work with, like lending partners to work with that can give them other advantages,” Gehrke said. “That's key to working with somebody like Rocket, the same thing with UWM, all those things that they're working to provide to that broker community.
“If brokers don't have the kind of budget to create these technological improvements and benefits, they need a partner to do that. I think brokers can equally compete if they have the right partnerships and if they're focused on their competitive advantage, which is that personal relationship.”

Missouri Housing Affordability: Is a 50-Year Mortgage the Answer? 
 by Mathew Pilger | Nov 21, 2025
Economist on Trump’s trade war: ""We need freer trade, not restrictions on trade""  
 
Could a fifty-year mortgage make buying a home easier in Missouri? 
President Trump has proposed the idea to lower monthly payments, but Jeff Jones, Associate Dean at the College of Business at Missouri State University told Missourinet that people would be paying a tremendous amount of interest.

“It’s an even greater piece of that payment that is dedicated towards paying interest, said Jones. “So, for me that is the biggest concern with a 50-year mortgage would be the fact that homeowners might pay on that loan for many, many years and really build very little equity in the home.” 
Jones told Missourinet that his sense is this proposal will not come to fruition. 
“My opinion on this particular proposal is that it’s not a great proposal,” said Jones. “I don’t believe it’s really in the best interest of homeowners in the long term. Could it potentially allow certain couples or individuals to be able to afford a home that they couldn’t otherwise? Yes, that’s true.” 
According to National Association of Realtors Chief Economist Dr. Lawrence Yun, while a 50-year mortgage may slightly ease monthly payments, it comes at the cost of slow equity growth and significantly higher interest—underscoring that the real affordability challenge lies in the lack of homes, not the length of the loan. 
“If it’s something that made sense, right, I think the private market would have already developed such a product,” said Jones. “There was a time when even the 30-year mortgage was considered….’Ohh, you know, is this really a feasible product…. all that kind of stuff.” And you know, we’ve seen that it has been, but I really questioned whether or not a 50-year mortgage is in the interest of homeowners.” 
The Missouri Relators Association has not weighed in on the issue yet.

WASHINGTON (TNND) — The Federal Reserve signaled this week that aspiring home buyers expecting more interest-rate relief may have to keep waiting. And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.

It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)

It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.

How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater Mortgages

Being “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.

But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.

Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:

27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.
18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.
10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.

The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.

When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.

What Happens When You’re Underwater?

For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.

You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.
You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.
The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.
It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.

In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.

Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?

Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.

Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”

The Upside: Lower Payments

Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)

A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.

A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.

Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.

The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger Risks

There would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example:

30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,000
50-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000

You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.

The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.

The Bottom Line

Builder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.

Meanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.

City Council plans to wreck NYC’s housing market in name of affordability, ‘saving’ it

City Council radicals are speeding toward their goal of destroying New York’s housing market in the name of “saving” it.
Progressives want to “decommodify” residential real estate by turning it into “social housing” run by politically connected nonprofits.
That is: a system much worse than NYCHA.
The scheme would grant “qualified” insiders an effective veto on the sale of already “distressed” residential buildings by imposing a six-month “right of first refusal” period on owners and buyers.

Say you own a three-family rental property, and want to sell it: Under this “Community Opportunity to Purchase Act,” you must announce your intent to put your property up for sale at a listed price and then wait six months — subject to extensions — to see if a city-approved nonprofit outfit wants to buy it by matching that price.
Only then can you make the building “available for sale in the public market.”
This madness means huge headaches for sellers, and would drive investors to look anywhere else: No responsible party will put up with the hassles and delays.
Families who inherit property often have to sell to pay taxes and divide estates; this six-month holding period imposes obvious hardship.

Cue the complete cratering of values of already distressed properties — which is probably the goal of the legislation in the first place.
That is: Insane state laws already have masses of apartment buildings underwater all across town; this is a bid to force owners to sell at even more of a loss.
City Councilwoman Pierina Sanchez says it’ll mean “housing that is socially owned by public entities.”
Except that connected insiders will control those “public entities”; tenants will be at their mercy.
Real socialism always proves to be far more cruel than “heartless capitalism.”

(TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk.

And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It’s a trend analysts say didn’t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing “underwater” on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate’s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, “you owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed”.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022–2024 landed in that position almost immediately. That’s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels — in exchange for higher home prices.Here’s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar’s FHA loans from 2022–2024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton’s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans’ FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that’s already near, or above, the home’s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You’re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can’t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can’t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they’re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a “lifetime mortgage.”The Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250–$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You’d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they’d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry’s lending incentives need a closer look.Meanwhile, Trump’s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.TrendingIs there price-fixing in the beef industry?Beef prices aren't likely to move much after Tyson Foods announced the closure of one of its plants, according to an agricultural economist.Experts share tips for enjoying a heart-healthy Thanksgiving without sacrificing traditionStruggle with making your food heart-healthy?

The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy.

The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices.

WASHINGTON (TNND) — The Trump administration is considering another method to bring down soaring housing costs through mortgage rates that are pricing people out of homeownership and keeping homes from coming onto the market.

Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating “portable mortgages,” which would allow homebuyers to take their mortgage rate with them when they decide to move. The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.

Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.

Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.

“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”

Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.

But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.

“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.

Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.

Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)Comment on this story0CommentShare storySharetopics: Mortgage ratesPortable mortgagesHousing affordabilityLock-in effectHomeownershipHousing supplyMortgage-backed securitiesTariffsWASHINGTON (TNND) — The Trump administration is considering another method to bring down soaring housing costs through mortgage rates that are pricing people out of homeownership and keeping homes from coming onto the market.Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating “portable mortgages,” which would allow homebuyers to take their mortgage rate with them when they decide to move. The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.TrendingErika Kirk opens up about wishing for pregnancy after husband's tragic assassinationKirk joined Megyn Kelly for a live interview on the last stop of Kelly's Sirius XM tour in Glendale, Arizona.

WASHINGTON (TNND) — The Trump administration is considering another method to bring down soaring housing costs through mortgage rates that are pricing people out of homeownership and keeping homes from coming onto the market.
Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating “portable mortgages,” which would allow homebuyers to take their mortgage rate with them when they decide to move. The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.
Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.

Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.

“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”

Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.
But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.
“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.
Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.
Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.
The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.

The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.
A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.
Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.
Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.
Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.

Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates.

That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices.

WASHINGTON (TNND) — The Trump administration is considering another method to bring down soaring housing costs through mortgage rates that are pricing people out of homeownership and keeping homes from coming onto the market.
Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating “portable mortgages,” which would allow homebuyers to take their mortgage rate with them when they decide to move. The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.
Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.

Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.

“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”

Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.
But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.
“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.
Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.
Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.
The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.

The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.
A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.
Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.
Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.
Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.

The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy.

That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices.

The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)Comment on this story0CommentShare storySharetopics: Mortgage ratesPortable mortgagesHousing affordabilityLock-in effectHomeownershipHousing supplyMortgage-backed securitiesTariffsWASHINGTON (TNND) — The Trump administration is considering another method to bring down soaring housing costs through mortgage rates that are pricing people out of homeownership and keeping homes from coming onto the market.Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating “portable mortgages,” which would allow homebuyers to take their mortgage rate with them when they decide to move. The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture.

The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market.

WASHINGTON (TNND) — The Trump administration is considering another method to bring down soaring housing costs through mortgage rates that are pricing people out of homeownership and keeping homes from coming onto the market.

Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating “portable mortgages,” which would allow homebuyers to take their mortgage rate with them when they decide to move. The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.

Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.

Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.

“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”

Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.

But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.

“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.

Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.

Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.

The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.

The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.

A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.

Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.

Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.

The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.TrendingOne person airlifted after fight at Glenbrook Apartments in Cedar Rapids Sunday nightOne individual was airlifted to the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics following a fight at Glendbrook Apartments on Sunday night.The incident occurred jHawkeyes are biggest winners in new WBB AP Top 25 PollIowa moved up more spots than any other squad in this week's women's basketball AP Top 25 poll.Jan Jensen's squad jumped up eight spots to No. 11 in the countryCrab House opens in Coralville, serving seafood lovers dailyA new seafood spot is now open in Coralville.Crab House Seafood Boil and Bar officially opened its doors Saturday, Nov. 22.The restaurant is open daily from 1WEEKEND SNOW?

WASHINGTON (TNND) — The Trump administration is considering another method to bring down soaring housing costs through mortgage rates that are pricing people out of homeownership and keeping homes from coming onto the market.

Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating “portable mortgages,” which would allow homebuyers to take their mortgage rate with them when they decide to move. The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.

Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.

Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.

“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”

Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.

But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.

“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.

Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.

Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.

The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.

The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.

A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.

Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.

Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.

Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.

The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.TrendingTwo people rescued from vault in downtown BakersfieldThe Bakersfield Fire Department responded to a call around 1:25 a.m. Sunday Morning regarding two people found in a dumbwaiter-type vault at 1918 20th St.Kern County prepares for an extended dry spell as Pacific ridging deflects storm tracksFor the first time since the first half of this month, Kern County is expecting an extended period of dry weather - lasting more than several hours!Pacific ridgMan found shot and killed inside east Bakersfield homeThere is significant presence of Kern County Sheriff's deputies at 2743 Center St. in east Bakersfield.The reason for the heavy law enforcement activity remainOff-roading crash near Arvin leaves one dead, another hospitalizedOne passenger died, and a driver is hospitalized after a solo-vehicle crash with an off-road vehicle in Arvin, Saturday afternoon.The California Highway Patrol Hard Rock Casino Tejon celebrates two major jackpots totaling over $260,000The winning streak at Hard Rock Casino Tejon continued Saturday night as two guests hit life-changing jackpots totaling more than $260,000.NEWS IN PHOTOS:""Local""3Toys for Tots event offers family fun at Cherry Acres3Hard Rock Casino Tejon celebrates two major jackpots totaling over $260,0004Man found shot and killed inside east Bakersfield home5Off-roading crash near Arvin leaves one dead, another hospitalizedACCESSIBILITYDownload Our Mobile Apps:Terms & ConditionsCopyright NoticesEEO Public File ReportKBAK FCC InfoKBAK FCC ApplicationsKBFX FCC InfoKBFX FCC ApplicationsPublic File AssistanceContactNews TeamCareersContestsNewsWeatherSportsGame CenterPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyDo Not Sell or ShareCookie Preferencestwitter iconfacebook icon 2025 Sinclair, Inc.",https://mynews4.com/news/nation-world/trump-administration-tries-to-break-through-lock-in-effect-with-portable-mortgages-housing-market-affordability-tariffs,"Washington, Washington, United States",38.8951,-77.0364,1,mynews4.com

Trump Administration Poses Another Possible Solution to Housing Affordability: The Portable Morgtage

Just days after President Trump floated the idea of a 50-year mortgage as a possible solution to the growing housing affordability crisis, Bill Pulte, the Federal Housing Finance Agency director, said the Trump administration is “actively evaluating portable mortgages.”We are actively evaluating portable mortgages.— Pulte (@pulte) November 12, 2025Although Pulte did not provide any details on how a portable mortgage would work, in theory, it would allow homeowners to transfer their current mortgage rates from one home to another. Portable mortgages may also ease the slowdown in home sales caused by the so-called ‘lock-in effect,’ where homeowners hesitate to sell their home, because they don’t want to give up their low-interest mortgage and take on a more expensive loan.The discussion of potential solutions to affordability comes just weeks after Republicans suffered defeats in several high-profile elections nationwide, including Virginia, New Jersey, and most notably New York City, where a democratic socialist triumphed over an establishment Democrat. His platform focuses on addressing the growing affordability crisis but relies heavily on increased government control, rent freezes, higher taxes, and other socialist measures, likely to exacerbate the issue.By contrast, President Trump is pursuing concrete measures to address the affordability crisis, focusing on practical, results-driven policies rather than utopian proposals. He has acknowledged that affordability is an urgent concern for many Americans, especially younger voters, and is taking decisive steps to help them achieve the American Dream.

By Betsy McCaugheyPUBLISHED: November 14, 2025 at 3:04 AM EST Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...Homeowners vote red. Renters vote blue.
Will President Donald Trump’s 50-year mortgage make a red voter out of you?
That is what the president hoped on Saturday, when he posted the idea of stretching out the customary 30-year repayment terms for home mortgages to 50 years.
Turns out, that idea is smoke and mirrors. But at least Trump is recognizing that home affordability is a real crisis, not fake news.
“Affordability” is the campaign pledge that produced big wins on election day, and most of the winners were Democrats.
Affording a home is increasingly out of reach. The median age of the first-time homebuyer just hit 40 years old, according to the National Association of Realtors. Many women are worried about hitting the brick wall of no longer being able to bear children, and they still can’t afford a starter home.
In 1991, the median age of someone buying their first home was 28, but in the last few years it’s become the impossible dream for people even in their 30s. The implications are huge, not only for starting a family but also for voting.
Renters favor Democrats by almost two to one, according to data from the American National Election Studies. Homeowners are twice as likely as renters to identify as “strongly Republican,” reports Aziz Sunderji, an economist who analyzed several decades of this data.
Starting in the 1970s, renters were slightly more inclined to vote Democratic than Republican, but in the last 20 years, they have swung sharply leftward.
Making homeownership possible is not only good policy. For Republicans, it’s smart politics.
In New York City, people in their 30s who are earning good money — as much as $120,00 or more, according to economics reporter John Carney — cannot make the leap to homeownership. In the mayoral election, strong support for democratic socialist mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani came from Brooklyn neighborhoods inhabited by “downwardly mobile professionals” who are settling for cramped rental apartments and roommates. They have “no hope of buying a home,” Carney reports.
Scalded by the election results across the nation last week, Trump floated the idea of a 50-year mortgage on Truth Social, with side-by-side pictures of himself and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who devised the 30-year mortgage after the Depression to relieve homeowners.
The 50-year mortgage is a nonstarter because it’s prohibited by Dodd-Frank, among other reasons. But there are realistic steps to help first-time buyers get into the market.
Lowering mortgage rates will help. Many current homeowners, especially the elderly, who would like to downsize are locked into their current homes because they’re financed at low rates. If they sell and buy a new property, they’ll be stuck with higher interest rates. So they’re waiting, keeping urgently needed inventory off the market.
Trump has been all over Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. He’s already done so twice, in September and October.
But long term, this is a problem of supply and demand. To increase the supply of new homes for sale, builders need to feel confident buyers will be able to pay the price. At the end of October, builder confidence was 37 out of 100, according to the National Association of Home Builders. What will boost their confidence? Job growth and consumer confidence.
With the government shutdown ending, job market data will soon be available again. Builders will be watching.
Meanwhile, politicians will have their eyes on the polls. Behind the poll numbers is widespread discontent that the American dream of homeownership is far out of reach. Republicans hoping to make gains in next year’s midterm elections better pay attention.
Meanwhile, Democrats know where their votes are: renters. In many states Democrats are pushing towns with mostly single-family housing to build apartment buildings, including units to be rented to low-income families. Trump identifies this as the Democrats’ “war on the suburbs.”
In Connecticut, leftists aligned with Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont are ramming through a bill this week that mandates how much affordable rental housing every region of the state will build. Forcing small Connecticut towns like Easton or Wilton to build apartment buildings and accommodate a large influx of renters will push up property taxes, as the towns have to build sewer lines, bus lines and more schools. The higher property taxes go, the further out of reach buying a single-family home is, especially to first-time homebuyers.
But Democrats are turning a deaf ear to these objections. They know the fundamental truth. The more renters move into a red town, the more likely that town is to flip blue.

2025-11-14 01:45:00,"Coldwell Banker Real Estate has released its 2025 American Dream Report, finding that a majority of aspiring homeowners are postponing at least one major life decision — marriage, children, career changes, and even pet ownership — until they can afford to purchase a home.
The company commissioned The Harris Poll to survey more than 3,000 U.S. adults, including nearly 900 aspiring homeowners, to examine how homeownership fits into modern definitions of the American Dream.
Among those hoping to buy a home, 18% said they are delaying marriage and an identical share are postponing having children.
Another 17% are holding off on changing jobs or careers or getting a pet and 16% said they are not living independently due to housing costs.
Fifteen percent reported delaying starting a business or going self-employed, while 71% are holding off on at least one life milestone, the report said.
“While affordability remains a significant hurdle, the desire for homeownership among Americans is so strong that many are restructuring their lives to make it a reality – from postponing parenthood to moving in with family to reduce expenses,” said Jason Waugh, President of Coldwell Banker Affiliates. “This report underscores that people view homeownership not only as a foundation for personal and financial stability, but also as one of the most effective vehicles for building long-term wealth – often surpassing the stock market in perceived value.”
Affordability hurdles affect milestone schedule
Younger adults appear to be restructuring early-adulthood milestones around affordability barriers.
Eighty-four percent of Gen Z respondents said they are postponing at least one life decision until they can afford a home — and nearly 29% reported delaying having children.
Yet more than half of aspiring first-time buyers (53%) do not expect to purchase a home until age 40 or later, suggesting further delays in household formation.
Despite market constraints, homeownership remains closely tied to the American Dream.
Fifty-six percent of Americans said owning a home best represents what the American Dream means to them personally, surpassing marriage, children, retirement, career success or earning a college degree.
Eighty-five percent said homeownership remains part of the national ideal, and 83% of non-owners expressed interest in buying someday — including 97% of Gen Z adults and 93% of Millennials.
Financial considerations play a significant role: 65% of Americans view homeownership as a smarter long-term financial decision than renting, and nearly half (48%) consider real estate a better wealth-building tool than the stock market.
Co-buying gains steam
The report also found that Americans are adjusting their strategies to cope with affordability challenges.
Eighty-four percent said they are willing to make concessions such as taking on side jobs (42%), buying smaller or less-ideal homes (35%) or moving to more affordable regions (35%).
Co-buying is also emerging as a strategy, as 36% of respondents said they’ve considered purchasing a home with family members and 33% have weighed buying with a non-romantic partner.
Nineteen percent of Gen Z and 14% of Millennials reported moving in with parents or in-laws to save for a future home.
Still, optimism remains strong, with 63% of non-homeowners saying they hope to buy a home within the next five years — including 70% of Gen Z adults and 72% of Millennials.
“When people delay major life events in pursuit of homeownership, it inevitably shapes patterns in household formation and consumer behavior,” Waugh added. “That’s why unlocking homeownership matters, and why working with a trusted, knowledgeable real estate professional can be the key to helping people successfully navigate the market and achieve that milestone with confidence.”

Trump Administration Poses Another Possible Solution to Housing Affordability: The Portable Morgtage
Share this post
https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/282/8e489ae3-077f-4f2e-8bfe-037c3bbde3da.jpg
Just days after President Trump floated the idea of a 50-year mortgage as a possible solution to the growing housing affordability crisis, Bill Pulte, the Federal Housing Finance Agency director, said the Trump administration is “actively evaluating portable mortgages.”
We are actively evaluating portable mortgages.
— Pulte (@pulte) November 12, 2025
Although Pulte did not provide any details on how a portable mortgage would work, in theory, it would allow homeowners to transfer their current mortgage rates from one home to another.
Portable mortgages may also ease the slowdown in home sales caused by the so-called ‘lock-in effect,’ where homeowners hesitate to sell their home, because they don’t want to give up their low-interest mortgage and take on a more expensive loan.
The discussion of potential solutions to affordability comes just weeks after Republicans suffered defeats in several high-profile elections nationwide, including Virginia, New Jersey, and most notably New York City, where a democratic socialist triumphed over an establishment Democrat. His platform focuses on addressing the growing affordability crisis but relies heavily on increased government control, rent freezes, higher taxes, and other socialist measures, likely to exacerbate the issue.
By contrast, President Trump is pursuing concrete measures to address the affordability crisis, focusing on practical, results-driven policies rather than utopian proposals. He has acknowledged that affordability is an urgent concern for many Americans, especially younger voters, and is taking decisive steps to help them achieve the American Dream.

As CT Senate Takes Up Housing Bill, Carpenters Say Wage Theft Undermines Affordability Goals

Hartford, CT – As the Connecticut Senate met Thursday to vote on a sweeping housing package, members of Carpenters Local 326 gathered outside the Legislative Office Building holding banners from job sites where the Department of Labor has issued stop-work orders for payroll violations, unpaid wages, and worker misclassification. Their message to lawmakers was blunt: the state can’t build affordable housing on exploited labor.

“This is happening in all four corners of the state,” said Miguel Fuentes, president of Local 326 and a representative for the North Atlantic States Regional Council of Carpenters. He said out-of-state developers and contractors, from as far as Florida, are profiting from community redevelopment funds and tax abatements while cutting corners on labor.

“They decide they’re going to build these projects on the cheap and not pay workers’ time, not pay unemployment, not pay workers’ comp, and not pay wages,” he said.

The demonstration coincided with the Senate’s special session to advance a housing bill designed to expand the state’s rental stock through zoning incentives, streamlined permitting, and new development subsidies. The House approved the bill Wednesday. 

While the proposal aims to accelerate construction, it contains no provisions addressing wage theft or labor misclassification — an omission unions say could undercut affordability goals before construction begins.

Fuentes said wage theft and misclassification have surged over the past two decades, particularly on publicly supported housing projects.

“We’ve got skilled Connecticut workers ready to go, but contractors bring in out-of-state crews they can exploit. It drains wages and stability from our communities,” he said.

Recent enforcement actions show the pattern. In East Hartford, three principals of ITO Construction and Hotel Renovation Solutions were arrested after investigators found they paid workers in cash and misclassified them on a Fairfield Marriott project. 

In Meriden, subcontractors for A.R. Building Company drew eight stop-work orders after 50 workers went unpaid for nearly two months—roughly $150,000 in stolen wages—before one carpenter was killed on site.

In New Haven, the Labor Department halted work at Spinnaker Real Estate’s 34 Fair Street development for misclassifying employees. In Bridgeport and Hartford, inspectors cited contractors for payroll and insurance violations at major redevelopment projects.

“These are real jobs, real violations, and taxpayers end up footing the bill,” Fuentes said.

A recent advisory from the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network flagged construction as a high-risk industry for money laundering, tax fraud, and human trafficking. Construction workers, already struggling to make ends meet, are especially vulnerable.

A UC Berkeley Labor Center study found 39% of Connecticut construction-worker families rely on public assistance. Misclassification drains thousands of dollars per worker in lost payroll taxes.

Nationally, between 1.1 and 2.1 million construction workers are misclassified or paid off the books each year — costing more than $12 billion in stolen wages and up to $10 billion in lost tax revenue.

Fuentes said unions have pushed stronger enforcement tools for three sessions, and lawmakers have begun to take notice. Earlier this year, Comptroller Sean Scanlon backed a bill that would allow his office to withhold payments from state contractors found violating wage laws after a 2024 audit uncovered nearly 1,000 wage-theft complaints stalled at the Department of Labor. The Senate approved the measure, but it died without a House vote before the 2025 session ended.

“If there is a company that’s shortchanging workers, we’re gonna shortchange them,” Scanlon reportedly said at the time. 

Union leaders are also pressing for contractor-liability legislation — already in place in 10 states — that would hold general contractors responsible for wage theft committed by subcontractors, suggesting a proposal that would apply to private projects with at least 15 units and include a 30-day window to correct violations without affecting municipalities.

“If we want real affordability, everyone has to play by the rules,” Fuentes said. “Connecticut workers should earn enough to live in the homes they build. Do it right, and we fix problems. Do it wrong, and we multiply them.”

Residents talk Flock, housing affordability at city council meeting
Eugene City Council opened the floor to public comment on Nov. 10.

The Eugene City Council held a meeting on Monday, facilitating discussion surrounding Automated License Plate Readers, Amazon distribution facility rumors and housing affordability programs.
All councilors were present during the meeting, with Councilor Leech calling in from Zoom.
During the Committee Reports and Items of Interest, Mayor Knudson spoke about community concerns surrounding the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the city.
“Last week, I joined elected leaders serving at the federal, state and local levels — indeed many of our city council members — in opposing the violent detention of our neighbors and the denial of due process to members of our community by (ICE),” Knudson said. “This situation is not news to us, but it is nonetheless alarming and unacceptable to learn of reported actions carried out by ICE and Lane County.”
City Manager Sarah Medary was also present, and spoke briefly before public comment regarding the status of growth research from the Envision Eugene Technical Advisory Committee. Medary said she believes EETAC will have a final report on the city’s economic growth and recommendations by January.
Forty-nine speakers signed up for public comment, many of which used their time to urge the council to permanently take down the ALPRs. Some speakers asked Medary to move quickly in setting up another work session before her retirement in December.
“A pause is not a stop, and the cameras remain up on the poles. That’s unfortunate, because they are pretty offensive to see, and pretty embarrassing to our visitors as well,” Sam Edwards, one public commentator, said. “I’m here tonight to urge the city manager to move with haste before retiring and get that contract where it belongs — the paper shredder.”
Another group of commentators wore homemade pins which said “Say No To Amazon” and spoke extensively on the new package-and-delivery center being built by the Eugene airport, which has been rumored to be an Amazon distribution center..
“Employment that Amazon offers is labor intensive, so intensive that to meet their goals, Amazon will be replacing local workers, in just a few years in 2030, with robots that work faster and don’t need bathroom breaks, or healthcare,” Charmaine Landing, a member of Say No To Amazon, said. “Without dependable long term jobs, workers can’t plan for a future, which might include owning a home, supporting elders or sending kids to college. I honestly believe Amazon will not be a good partner for Eugene.”
Danny Patch, another public commentator, was worried about the effect of increased vehicles from the warehouse on traffic.
Multiple other public commentators urged the council to collaborate with local housing developers to tap into funds for affordable housing granted by the state legislature through the Moderate Income Revolving Loan.
MIRL is a program that was established during the 2024 legislative session from Senate Bill 1537. The program enables the Oregon Housing and Community Services to offer no-interest loans to cities and jurisdictions that meet specific requirements to build low to moderate income housing.
“(OCHS has) $50 million for (MIRL), but in that case, the council needs to adopt a resolution to enable the program here locally,” Emily Reiman, CEO of Dev Northwest, a non-profit community development organization, said. “The city needs to adopt an application process for developers to apply for those funds.”
When public comment concluded, Councilors Clark and Groves expressed their interest in learning more about MIRL, asking for a later discussion with Medary.
The next city council meeting is scheduled for Nov. 24.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)Comment on this story0CommentShare storySharetopics: Mortgage ratesPortable mortgagesHousing affordabilityLock-in effectHomeownershipHousing supplyMortgage-backed securitiesTariffsWASHINGTON (TNND) — The Trump administration is considering another method to bring down soaring housing costs through mortgage rates that are pricing people out of homeownership and keeping homes from coming onto the market.Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte said the administration is “actively evaluating “portable mortgages,” which would allow homebuyers to take their mortgage rate with them when they decide to move. The proposal is a direct bid to confront the so-called “lock-in effect,” where homeowners are unwilling or unable to part with their lower mortgage rate and keeping their home off the market.Many homeowners were able to buy or refinance during the pandemic for ultra-low rates at or below 3%, which cuts hundreds of dollars off a monthly mortgage payment. Rates have been stuck between 6 to 7% for the last several years, creating a barrier for homeowners to put their homes up for sale as they don’t want to take up a new loan at higher rates. More than half of homeowners with a mortgage have a rate below 4%, according to Redfin.Homes are changing hands at the lowest rate in decades in 2025 in a market that has been in a standstill for years as mortgage rates climbed and economic uncertainty set in. A Redfin analysis found only 2.8% of homes in the U.S. have turned over to a new owner in 2025.“Buyers are walking away from deals more often, sometimes due to affordability issues and sometimes because they’re re-evaluating whether now is the right moment to commit,” Redfin head of economic research Chen Zhao said in a release. “Others aren’t even shopping, waiting instead for prices or mortgage rates to come down. On the other side, many sellers are staying put—either because they’re locked into low rates or unwilling to accept offers below expectations.”Allowing people to take their mortgage rate with them to a new property could help boost the supply of existing homes on the market if more homeowners are willing to move with their lower rate.But it could also come with higher list prices as more people enter a market with a limited pool of homes available to buy. Homeowners would also have an advantage on bidding compared to a new buyer who is working with today’s rates with more wiggle room in their budgets.“Anyone able to ‘port’ a 3% mortgage into a new purchase would effectively be bidding with cheap financing in a 6% world. That added purchasing power would push prices up, while renters and mortgage-free owners would still face today’s higher rates—only now with even higher list prices,” Jake Krimmel, a senior economist at Realtor.com, wrote in an analysis.Portable mortgages could also disrupt the U.S. mortgage system and lead to higher rates. Mortgage-backed securities, groups of mortgages that lenders sell to investors, would have their pricing models blown up and create more risk for investors as less loans are paid off early with more homeowners taking them with them when they move.Pulte has also said officials are evaluating a plan to offer 50-year mortgages and how to make mortgages assumable, where homebuyers could take over a seller’s preexisting loan. Assumable mortgages are already available in the U.S. but are rarely used because they require a large cash payment or a second mortgage at current rates.The 50-year mortgage could lower monthly payments by stretching out the term of the loan but would also likely come with higher rates and would ultimately cost buyers more in interest over the life of the loan and make it take longer to build equity.The administration’s efforts to lower housing costs come as an increasing slice of Americans are being priced out of the market altogether with elevated mortgage rates and consistently growing list prices. Home values have climbed significantly compared to before the pandemic for both new and existing homes amid a lack of sufficient supply.A shortage of homes is widely seen as the biggest issue when it comes to tackling housing affordability in the United States. Construction cratered in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and has struggled to recover to a sufficient level to meet the demand.Housing starts have slumped in 2025 as builders confront cost challenges and a stalled market. Higher rates are also a challenge for construction, which is also impacted by the rising cost of labor and materials.Tariffs have been a double blow for builders, as the uncertainty around them has chilled activity in the housing market and broader economy. Import taxes have also increased the cost of materials used to build homes, making it more expensive for builders to start and complete projects.Tariffs that went into effect last month imposed a 10% tax on all timber and lumber imports, along with a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinet and furniture. The U.S. imports about one-third of its lumber, primarily from Canada, that are also subject to further tariffs.TrendingRail and supply chain experts question viability of Pacific Coast Intermodal Port Project The League of Women Voters of Coos County hosted an event with experts in different fields such as the supply chain industry, and the railroad industry.Fairfield man charged with making terrorist threat, held on $109,000 bondA Fairfield man is facing several charges, including making a terrorist threat.40-year-old Phillip Earl Allen, Jr., is being held in the Jefferson County Jail.Chilly Start to the Thanksgiving WeekMuch as we've seen for the past week, early morning temperatures will take a tumble to start the week...Oregon commercial Dungeness Crab season delayedOregon’s commercial Dungeness crab season will be delayed coastwide until at least Dec. 16, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) announced Friday.WSylva man arrested for setting woman on fire during domestic dispute A Sylva man has been arrested after setting a woman on fire during a domestic violence incident.NEWS IN PHOTOS:""Local""3Oregon Christmas tree farms face supply challenges amid rising costs21Wyden holds town hall to address Newport's helicopter move, potential immigration facility5Oregon offers support to laid-off Rogue Brewing workers through rapid response efforts4Cottage Grove Police K9 Sabrina killed in accident, department mourns lossACCESSIBILITYTerms & ConditionsCopyright NoticesEEO Public File ReportFCC InfoFCC ApplicationsPublic File AssistanceContactNews TeamCareersContestsNewsWeatherSportsGame CenterPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyDo Not Sell or ShareCookie Preferencestwitter iconfacebook icon 2025 Sinclair, Inc.",https://wjla.com/news/local/dc-council-committees-hear-from-community-on-housing-voucher-program-affordability-real-estate-homeless-human-services-assistance,"Washington, Washington, United States",38.8951,-77.0364,4,wjla.com

Report: Affordability gap grows for those seeking starter homes in Greater Boston
November 13, 2025
Katie Castellani, State House News Service

While housing construction is up and home prices have stabilized, researchers expect home buyers and renters will continue to face affordability headwinds in Massachusetts.

Home prices and rents have flattened in 2025 but are still “historically” high, according to a 108-page Greater Boston Housing Report Card 2025 released by The Boston Foundation and Boston Indicators on Wednesday.

“It’s easy to get lost in the numbers of units, permits, and cost burdens, but we must remind ourselves that at the end of the day, we are talking about real homes, families and communities,” Lee Pelton, CEO and president of the foundation, said in a statement.

While the gap between who can afford to live in the Greater Boston area and who can’t continues to widen, “these trends are not inevitable,” Pelton said during an event Wednesday where the report was unveiled.

“They reflect choices, policy choices, investment choices and collective priorities that we have the power to change,” he said.

The annual income a household needs to afford an “entry-level” home rose from about $98,000 in 2021 to more than $162,000 in 2025, assuming a 3.5% down payment, according to the report. This trend is squeezing renters out of making the leap to home ownership. Just 15% of renter households can afford an “entry-level” home – down from 30% in 2021.

“The data show just how much work we have to do if we are to expand opportunities and unfreeze the market,” Luc Schuster, executive director of Boston Indicators, TBF’s research arm, said in a statement.

Renters continue to face stiff prices.

The Greater Boston area has the fifth most expensive rental market in the country in 2025, according to the report, which cited the Zillow Observed Rent Index that tracks changes in market rents across housing types.

New York, San Jose, San Francisco and San Diego were the only four markets with higher rental prices than Boston. In September 2025, the ZORI found rent for the Boston area was almost $3,000 per month, not including other housing costs like heat, electricity and water.

Rents across all neighborhoods within Boston metro core communities have risen since 2022, but increases slowed in some areas since 2024. Also, more than half of renters in Greater Boston are “cost-burdened,” meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on housing. More than one-quarter of renters spend more than 50% of their income on rent, meaning they are considered “severely cost-burdened.” Renters of color are cost burdened at higher levels, according to the report.

The report also noted that the rates of “cost-burdened” and “severely cost-burdened” may be overstated because the estimates – based on American Community Survey data – might inflate the cost burden for those in subsidized housing. Still, many in the region face affordability pressures.

A shortage of rental units in Boston is one of the main drivers for the city’s high rent prices. While vacancy rates across most major U.S. cities have fallen in the past two decades, Boston’s was particularly low – just 3% in 2024. However, the report noted there are early indicators that vacancy rates may be rising in some neighborhoods with more students, likely because of a drop in international student enrollment under President Trump’s immigration policies.

Census Address Counts, a dataset from the Census Bureau tracking a list of addresses, show that the Greater Boston area created more than 70,000 homes since 2020, marking a steady increase, according to the report.

But, the best available data on new construction permits, which are seen as a key indicator for future housing construction, have dropped. As of July 2025, the number of new permits issued are 44% below the levels for the same period in 2021. High construction costs and interest rates have made funding projects more difficult and are a key cause of the slowdown, especially when compounded with existing barriers like restrictive zoning, costly building code requirements and lengthy approval processes, according to the report.

The report noted that declining permitting doesn’t bode well for Gov. Maura Healey’s goal of constructing 220,000 additional homes in the state between 2025 and 2035. Since Healey took office in 2023, 90,400 homes have been “completed, started construction, or proposed,” according to the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities.

While it looks like the state is making progress on its goal, most of the 90,400 homes were built or permitted before 2025. If the pace of completions between 2023 and 2025 is kept up, Massachusetts would be on track to meet its goal of building 220,000 homes by 2035. But at the current pace of permitting, it’s unlikely the state will meet its construction goal.

Many of the homes recently completed were projects that were likely financed with “historically low” interest rates in the 2010s and 2020s, according to the report. Now, with more tariffs on building materials, workforce challenges and higher borrowing costs, getting projects financed is more difficult.

There are a lot of “intractable” challenges within government, but housing shouldn’t be one of them, said Lt. Gov. Kimberley Driscoll, during an event Wednesday where the report was unveiled.

”It should not be as hard as it is,"" she said, adding that it’s important for local and state officials as well as housing developers and communities to work together.

Driscoll added the state’s goal of building 220,000 units by 2035 is reachable.

Homelessness hit record high levels in 2024 and dipped slightly in early 2025. However, the report noted that most recent available data was collected in January and may not reflect more recent shifts. Also, emergency assistance caseloads have dropped “dramatically” in 2025 – falling by almost half from January to July, according to the report, which said questions remain about whether those who exited shelters secured permanent housing or fell back into homelessness.

The report noted several moves by state leaders that contributed to this drop, including capping the shelter system to 4,000 families in July, a move which will take effect Dec. 31. On Aug. 1, the governor also ended the state of emergency she declared in 2023 and closed all remaining hotel shelters.

SUPPORT WBUR

The report also included a section with research by the Boston University Initiative on Cities on what communities have done to meet requirements outlined in the MBTA Communities Act. The section also includes a case study on how Lexington, Needham and Wellesley responded to the law.

The act requires 177 cities and towns in the MBTA service area to change their zoning and land use policies to allow for construction of more housing – without requiring more housing to get built. The law has received a lot of media attention over controversy surrounding communities working on creating compliant plans.

Each community has had its own approach to complying with the law, and each faced many options. In 2025, the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities has approved plans for 106 municipalities. Another 56 communities are in conditional or interim compliance – meaning their processes are in progress or submissions are under review. Also, 15 communities with deadlines in July 2025 were not compliant as of Sept. 5. and 27 communities have deadlines in December, according to the report.

Indeed, Driscoll said the law has been a “source of inspiration and at times a source of frustration.”

Existing home sales, one unintended source of housing unaffordability

Many cities today face the challenge of increasing the availability of affordable housing. The common approach is to find ways to generate more new housing. That usually involves municipal or state subsidies or tax breaks for land and development. A recent analysis by Moody’s Analytics suggests there may be an additional way to address this problem.

In 2000, according to the Los Angeles Times, a near-record 493,000 existing single-family homes were sold in California. By 2023, the California Association of Realtors reported that existing home sales had dropped to nearly half that amount (258,000). This is even though the mortgage rate back then was over 8% but less than 7% in 2023. Of course, there are many factors other than interest rates that impact existing home sales. Mark Zandi and Cristian deRitis at Moody’s, in a report titled “Capital Gains Taxes and the Misallocation of Housing” (tinyurl.com/Moodys-capital-gains), assert that one major cause is federal capital gains tax policy. According to the report, the Census Bureau found that the average square footage (sq. ft.) of a home per capita in the U.S. is 700 sq. ft. Based on that, the average home size for a family of two would be expected to be around 1,400 sq. ft., for a family of three 2,100 sq. ft., and 2,800 sq. ft. for a four-person family. But that’s not how the data breaks down. There are actually 3.5 million homes larger than 2,500 sq. ft. occupied by only one or two seniors aged 65-74 and another 2.3 million owned by seniors aged 75 and older. That’s almost six million houses that could be utilized more efficiently by larger families.

One of the reasons younger homeowners are often reluctant to sell their homes is because they are holding onto mortgages with rates significantly lower than current rates. But most older homeowners have paid off their mortgages or have only small balances remaining.

Why aren’t they downsizing from homes that are not only bigger than they need but frequently require more work to maintain? The report blames the high capital gains taxes associated with senior home sales. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 established an exclusion of $250K for single taxpayers or $500K for married taxpayers from taxes on the gains from home sales by taxpayers over age 55. At the time this was a high enough threshold that few people faced significant taxes. But over the nearly three decades since then, home prices have risen 250% on average across the U.S. but this exclusion amount has not changed at all.

The report suggests that if the capital gains tax exclusion for senior home sales were to be increased to $885K/$1.775K, matching average housing price inflation since 1997, more seniors would be open to downsizing or to moving into senior living facilities. They cite research suggesting not only the improvement in housing liquidity from this change but also economic benefits such as reduced regional unemployment.

Zandi and deRitis also identify possible ways to cover the estimated $6-$10 billion in lost federal tax revenue from such a change. Whether or not the Trump administration would consider such an attempt to further modify tax revenues is anybody’s guess.

The report does not directly address another goal of seniors, namely passing on their homes to their children tax free due to the step-up in basis when they die. It’s not clear how much that goal overrides seniors’ reluctance to sell homes due to the capital gains tax exclusion.

The cost of housing in many locations in this country is a complex problem that municipalities and states are forced to deal with. Increasing the federal capital gains tax exclusion is certainly one way the federal government could contribute to helping solve the problem.

2025-11-13 17:15:00,"In developed economies, individuals are planning their milestones later in life than the generation before them. Parents are having children later, couples are getting married at older ages, and buying a home is coming further down the tracks as well. While some of these decisions are a matter of personal preference, others are a result of the economic cycle. While 90% of Gen Zers surveyed in a recent report said they want to own a home one day, 79% also said they are being priced out of the market.Recommended VideoLikewise, while 55% of millennials now reportedly own a home, it took them far longer to get a foot on the property ladder. According to Census Bureau Data analyzed in Apartment List’s 2025 millennial homeownership report, at age 30, 33% of millennials were homeowners, compared to 42% of Gen X and 48% of baby boomers.One eye-popping stat summed just how bad things have gotten in the recent past: the average age of the first-time homebuyer was 40 years old in 2025, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR). But Apollo chief economist Torsten Slok, one of Wall Street’s most influential analysts, put it in perspective on Thursday: the average age of any homebuyer has skyrocketed in the U.S. as well. As observed in a note (and chart) shared with Fortune today, Slok calculated from the same NAR dataset that the median age of all U.S. homebuyers in 2025 is 59 years old. Just 15 years ago, it was 39 years old.Slok’s reporting also shows the significant upward trajectory in the median age of buyers since the 2008 financial crisis. For example, between 1986 and 2007, the median age of American property buyers increased by only five years, from 34 to 39. 111325-ChartDownloadA disillusioned generationYoung consumers are suffering the sharpest end of a property market in an affordability crisis, according to Liam Bailey, global head of property consultants Knight Frank’s Research Department. Speaking to Fortune in an exclusive interview, he said: “I think it’s probably Gen Zs are the ones who are getting who are getting hit—I guess anyone who’s entering the market for the first time is probably most affected.”“[They’re] suffering the most … because they haven’t got a stake in [the market] at the moment, and they’re entering the market just at a time when rates are more expensive and there’s no stock out there,” he added.Owning the roof over one’s head has long been seen as a cornerstone of the American Dream, an ideal that is fading fast for young workers. Indeed, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently described how the benchmarks have changed for new entrants to the economy: “When you graduate, whether it’s high school, or community college, or college, you need the skills to get the job.“It’s not enough anymore to say, ‘I can work hard,'” Dimon said in a recent interview with CNN. “In the old days, you could be in 10th grade, go get a factory [job] in Detroit, and eventually you could afford a family, a home, a car, and that may not be true anymore.”",https://www.wbur.org/news/2025/11/13/housing-affordability-report-prices-stablize,"Massachusetts, United States",42.2373,-71.5314,46,wbur.org

While still the most expensive in the city, the roughly $5 million price tag represents a roughly 15% decrease from the $5.9 million median sales price in the second quarter of this year.Manhattan, which is home to six of the 10 most expensive neighborhoods, led all boroughs with a median sales price of $1,150,000 during the third quarter of the year, the same as during the third quarter of 2024.Brooklyn, which houses the fifth-, sixth-, seventh- and eighth-most expensive neighborhoods, had a median sales price of $916,000, roughly 11% higher than last year.Queens and the Bronx had median sales prices of $600,000 and $380,000, respectively, with 12 Queens neighborhoods and zero Bronx neighborhoods included in the top-50 most expensive across the city.Here’s a look at the 10 most expensive neighborhoods in New York City.1) Hudson Yards, ManhattanMedian sales price Q3 2025: $4,999,000Median sales price Q3 2024: N/AYear-over-year change: N/A2) TriBeCa, ManhattanMedian sales price Q3 2025: $3,773,000Median sales price Q3 2024: $3,898,000Year-over-year change: -3%3) SoHo, ManhattanMedian sales price Q3 2025: $3,363,000Median sales price Q3 2024: $4,250,000Year-over-year change: -21%4) Hudson Square, ManhattanMedian sales price Q3 2025: $2,650,000Median sales price Q3 2024: $1,850,000Year-over-year change: +43%5) Cobble Hill, BrooklynMedian sales price Q3 2025: $2,275,000Median sales price Q3 2024: $1,840,000Year-over-year change: +24%6) DUMBO, BrooklynMedian sales price Q3 2025: $1,925,000Median sales price Q3 2024: $1,667,000Year-over-year change: +15%7) Fort Greene, BrooklynMedian sales price Q3 2025: $1,895,000Median sales price Q3 2024: $1,138,000Year-over-year change: +67%8) Boerum Hill, BrooklynMedian sales price Q3 2025: $1,833,000Median sales price Q3 2024: $1,596,000Year-over-year change: +15%9) Central Midtown, ManhattanMedian sales price Q3 2025: $1,723,000Median sales price Q3 2024: $970,000Year-over-year change: +78%10) Flatiron District, ManhattanMedian sales price Q3 2025: $1,713,000Median sales price Q3 2024: $1,750,000Year-over-year change: -2%More Data Stories:Number of Staten Islanders living in poverty drops more than 14% in past year, data showsNearby airport tops list of most likely to see Thanksgiving travel delaysRepublican voter registration hits record-high on Staten Island: See how many call the borough homeNearly 4K homes sold on Staten Island in past year; these neighborhoods saw the most salesWeekly wages fall on Staten Island; See which New York counties earn the mostErik BascomeErik Bascome is an award-winning public interest and advocacy reporter for the Staten Island Advance and SILive.com.

Across New York City and the country, the word on everyone’s lips is “affordability.” Over the weekend, President Trump said his administration is preparing to tackle housing costs head-on with a proposal for 50-year mortgage terms for new homebuyers.
The United States Director of Federal Housing, Bill Pulte, reposted a Truth Social post from President Trump depicting a list of “Great American Presidents,” with President Trump shown alongside Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the creator of the 30-year mortgage. “Thanks to President Trump, we are indeed working on the 50-year mortgage – a complete game changer,” he wrote on Saturday.
Thanks to President Trump, we are indeed working on The 50 year Mortgage – a complete game changer. https://t.co/HZDPzO0qJG

On Sunday, Pulte followed up on the proposed 50-year mortgage, emphasizing that it is a potential tool to help young people purchase homes, though not necessarily the only solution. Since the initial announcement, the proposal has drawn widespread criticism from both sides of the political aisle.
We hear you. We are laser focused on ensuring the American Dream for YOUNG PEOPLE and that can only happen on the economic level of homebuying. A 50 Year Mortgage is simply a potential weapon in a WIDE arsenal of solutions that we are developing right now. STAY TUNED!

The goal of the 50-year mortgage would be to lower monthly payments; however, the reported decrease in a homebuyer’s monthly cost would be minimal, while the total amount paid in interest would increase substantially. Regardless, President Trump has heard the voice of the American people and is actively exploring options to ensure that younger generations of Americans can still afford a home and achieve their American Dream.

2025-11-12 05:30:00,"The Trump Administration is working to introduce 50-year mortgages for home buyers—a plan that has drawn criticism even from some of the President’s allies, and that experts warn could come with potentially major drawbacks.President Donald Trump suggested that his Administration would introduce 50-year mortgages in a Truth Social post over the weekend. Soon after, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte posted on X: “Thanks to President Trump, we are indeed working on The 50 year Mortgage—a complete game changer.”The 50-year mortgage would mark a significant extension on the most common type of mortgage in the U.S., a 30-year fixed mortgage, in which the loan is amortized—or paid off—over a 30-year period.Several right-wing commentators and lawmakers were quick to voice opposition to the idea, which Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said in a post on X would “ultimately reward the banks, mortgage lenders. and home builders while people pay far more in interest over time and die before they ever pay off their home.”The Trump Administration’s proposal also generated criticism from housing experts, who say that the benefits to home buyers would be minimal. Here’s what a 50-year mortgage would mean for prospective home buyers.What are the benefits?The monthly payments for a 50-year mortgage would be lower than those for a 30-year mortgage, according to Alex Schwartz, professor of urban policy at The New School. AdvertisementImagine, for instance, that a person is purchasing a $500,000 home with a 30-year mortgage. The current average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage is about 6.22%, according to Freddie Mac. That means if the home buyer put down a down payment of 20%, their monthly payment of the principal and interest would be $2,455, according to Fannie Mae’s mortgage calculator. But if they took out a 50-year mortgage, again with a down payment of 20%, then their monthly payment of principal and interest—assuming that the interest rate is the same—would be $2,171, according to Fannie Mae. That’s a little under $300 less than the monthly payment for a 30-year mortgage.“It’s a reduction, but it’s not dramatic,” Schwartz says of the difference between monthly payments for 30- and 50-year mortgages.He also notes that the interest rate for a 50-year mortgage likely wouldn’t be the same as that for a 30-year mortgage, which could reduce the potential savings. A higher interest rate is just one of a few possible drawbacks to a 50-year mortgage, he says.AdvertisementWhat are the drawbacks?One drawback of a 50-year mortgage is that it would take home buyers longer to pay off their debt.“If you were 30 years old and bought a home with a 30-year mortgage, it would be owned free and clear at age 60, so you’d only have to pay property taxes and maintenance on the home, no longer having to pay a mortgage during your older years or retirement,” Schwartz says. “If you were now paying a loan for a 50-year mortgage, and you’re 30, the mortgage wouldn’t end until you’re 80, and so you would have a period of time, most likely during retirement, where you have to pay the debt service costs on top of the property taxes and maintenance,” he continues.The other issue, Schwartz says, is that homeowners wouldn’t build equity as quickly with a 50-year mortgage as they would with a 30-year mortgage. For the first several years of a mortgage, a homeowner is primarily paying interest; it takes several years before they actually start reducing their debt. Buyers with a 50-year mortgage would be paying down their debt much more slowly compared to a 30-year mortgage.AdvertisementIf housing prices go down, Schwartz fears that people with a 50-year mortgage may then have negative equity, meaning they would owe more on their mortgage than their home is worth.Schwartz also says that, most likely, the interest rate for a 50-year mortgage would be higher than that of a 30-year mortgage. Currently, interest rates for 30-year mortgages are higher than those of 15-year mortgages.“There are major trade-offs here,” Schwartz says. “Your monthly payment is somewhat reduced, [but] it will take a lot longer to build equity in your home, it would take longer to actually retire the mortgage so that when you’re older your housing affordability problems would be greater when you’re out of the workforce than they would be if you have a 30-year mortgage, and you are at greater risk of having negative equity.”Would a 50-year mortgage help address housing affordability?According to Schwartz, not in any significant way. For people who are “squeezed” on their current mortgage, if they chose to refinance for a 50-year mortgage, their monthly payments would become more affordable, Schwartz says. But he warns that a longer-term mortgage would carry significant risks.Advertisement“Is this going to make home ownership more accessible for first-time home buyers? I don’t think so,” he says.Amid criticism over the proposal, Pulte acknowledged in a post on X on Sunday, “We hear you. We are laser focused on ensuring the American Dream for YOUNG PEOPLE and that can only happen on the economic level of homebuying. A 50 Year Mortgage is simply a potential weapon in a WIDE arsenal of solutions that we are developing right now. STAY TUNED!”The President also responded to criticism over the idea. In an interview with Fox News that aired on Monday, he said a 50-year mortgage is “not even a big deal.”“All it means is you pay less per month,” Trump said. “You pay it over a longer period of time. It’s not like a big factor. It might help a little bit.”",https://wcbm.com/national-headline/trump-administration-exploring-50-year-mortgage-plan-to-tackle-housing-affordability/,American,39.828175,-98.5795,46,wcbm.com
2025-11-12 03:45:00,"ColumnsNovember 10, 2025The choice on housing is between affordability and controlNorth Carolina’s struggle with affordable housing pits government control against market solutions, as strict zoning and planning rules often block new development despite rising demand and population growth.By David LarsonStock photo | paulbr75 via PixabayThe Local Government Commission, chaired by Republican State Treasurer Brad Briner, approved over $370 million in bonds around the state for affordable housing and retirement homes last week.In a press release, Briner said, “Affordable housing remains a challenge in North Carolina, and the Local Government Commission continues to fulfill its role in attacking the problem,” while also noting that the LGC “has a statutory duty to approve most debt issued by units of local government and public authorities in the state,” as long as they can show the debt amount is appropriate and the local government unit “can reasonably afford to repay the debt.”Thankfully, these bonds were mostly “conduit revenue bonds” where the financial risks are borne by the private builder and their bondholders, not the government. The builder simply gets access to a lower-cost loan through the local government in exchange for being allowed to carry out a project that local planners want to see. But even if this won’t bankrupt a town or county, it still reveals a misguided approach to “affordable housing.”If officials really want to make housing affordable in their areas, giving up this desire to micromanage the “planning process,” not pressing it further, is what will actually begin to attack the problem.To start with the positive, there really are some good trends. A lot of North Carolina’s more populous areas have loosened the restrictions on “single-family” zoned areas. Rather than just one dwelling per lot, city and county governments have been moving toward allowing things like accessory dwelling units (called ADUs or granny flats) and multi-family “missing middle” housing like duplexes, townhomes and quads.But even if they allow more variety and density in formerly single-family zoned areas, some government planners are not nearly as flexible if you want to build outside of designated urban areas.For a drastic comparison on this front, we can look at two Triangle-area counties, Orange and Wake. Wake has largely allowed building and now has multiple new major municipalities that were small towns at best just one generation ago (Morrisville, Cary, Rolesville, Knightdale, Apex, etc.).Orange County, on the other hand, has such strict local zoning rules that most of the county is locked in time. Chapel Hill had 26,199 people in 1970, while Cary had only 7,686. But the estimated populations for 2025 are 62,043 for Chapel Hill and 181,838 for Cary. So Chapel Hill, which had been the much bigger and more well-known city, basically doubled, while Cary grew 24 times larger — now bigger than not just Chapel Hill, but all of Orange County.And outside city limits, Orange County has grown even less. This is largely due to the county’s obsession with strict planning, as seen in its current “Comprehensive Land Use Plan.”The plan says that “per North Carolina General Statute 153A-121,” the county is authorized to “define, regulate, prohibit or abate acts, omissions or conditions detrimental to the health, safety or welfare of its citizens.”And county leaders take this authority in a very broad sense, saying that “this Comprehensive Plan will strive, in its implementation, to link the economy, the environment and social equity to improve the vitality of all three of these domains.”So, in short, they believe they can determine how all land in the county should be used and why (to achieve certain progressive social and environmental goals). To display just how extreme this is in practice, see the map of the areas where development is allowed and where it is severely limited. That bottom southeastern corner is where Chapel Hill/Carrboro is, and the area along I-85 is where Mebane, Hillsborough and a small portion of Durham are. The planners have decided that everything else should be left (permanently?) rural.Most of this land is designated low-density “rural residential,” while the area between the two largest population centers of Chapel Hill/Carrboro and Hillsborough (inside the yellow lines) is an even stricter “rural buffer,” despite that being the most obvious place to develop in a growing county. So, basically, if you want to build much of anything in the county, unless it’s in one of the approved human-activity zones, you’re probably out of luck.Even if you are a community of progressive artists and musicians who want to use a 90-acre property to create an environmentally conscious communal-living development for those 55-plus, where 60 of those acres are permanently set aside for natural conservation, you can’t — because that would “threaten the character of rural Orange County.” Fiddlehead Corner, the project in question, purchased its land and sought to build everything in as eco-friendly way as possible, but, in March, the developers were still denied.“The Orange County Board of County Commissioners unanimously denied the rezoning requested for H4D that would have allowed us to proceed with our plan to build Fiddlehead Corner as a clustered community on the Morrow Mill property,” said an update on the community’s website. “Several commissioners commented that the master plan was good, even wonderful. But their statements expressed concern that our proposed way of implementing the plan — expanding a rural activity node and siting a community there — sets a precedent that could lead to widespread imitation, which they fear would threaten the character of rural Orange County.”In a recent opinion piece in the Daily Tar Heel defending the “rural buffer” amid Orange County’s plan-updating process, the author noted that when the popular ice cream spot Maple View Farms “was bought out in 2021 by a cast of crooks” who “attempted to bastardize the sacred soil of Maple View Farms” with “a hotel and amphitheater with a capacity rivaling the scale of the Durham Performing Arts Center. The one thing that stopped this project from continuing? The Rural Buffer.”So this “buffer” not only prevents much-needed housing from being built, it also prevents a beloved landmark between Hillsborough and Chapel Hill from expanding and adding more attractions? Victory, I guess (mostly for those who already have the housing they need and don’t like fun).Because of the difficulty and humiliation in having to deal with “the planners,” many make decisions that allow them to avoid them altogether. A couple of years ago, I noticed that a whole stretch of lots in rural Orange County were exactly 10.01 acres and asked a real estate agent friend about why that would be. She explained to me that there is a state law that exempts landowners from most local subdivision and planning requirements if they split the land into lots greater than 10 acres.In growing urban regions like the Triangle, even if some think farms are beautiful to drive by, agriculture is no longer the “highest and best use” of the land. If a farmer sees that his land value has skyrocketed and wants to sell to a developer to build housing, which has become the highest and best use, he can’t, unless he goes to a planning department (who will tell him no, since it would violate rural character).So instead, he chops his 80-acre farm into eight 10-acre “estate” lots. Does it really “preserve rural character” and save farmland to have these eight lots owned by people with no interest in farming and who now have to mow massive lawns? Might it not be better for these aims to allow the farmer to sell off 10 1-acre lots and potentially keep the other 70 acres as a farm?(And a broader question: Would moving that statewide exemption from 10 acres to 1 acre add a lot more buildable land, thereby reducing building costs and increasing housing stock without major negative trade-offs? Somebody else can answer that one.)While my county is fairly extreme on this front, the same principle applies across the state. Officials look out across their jurisdiction like Mufasa from Pride Rock and begin the intoxicating process of planning what should be done with others’ land. “This part of town really should have more woods.” “The lots are too small (or big) on that street.” “A grocery store over there would be kind of an eyesore.” “I like all the farmland I see on my commute. It should stay that way.” And on and on.But they don’t always consider whether this should be their call to make — whether the Fiddlehead Corner community should have to align with their vision for the county, whether a farmer who wants to buy a bigger farm in a cheaper part of the state should be prevented from selling his land to a housing developer.
Yet somehow, these same commissioners frequently bemoan the lack of affordable housing. But a few government-planned “affordable housing” projects cannot make up for all of the private projects that have been blocked. There’s a much easier and cheaper way to make housing affordable: stop trying to control the process and let the market create the housing it needs.David Larson is managing editor of the John Locke Foundation’s Carolina Journal, where this column first appeared.AdvertisementRelatedColumnsNov. 24A $42 million investment in Wilson and its childrenColumnsNov. 2425 things I’m thankful for in 2025ColumnsNov. 24Whatley cheers ICE’s Charlotte invasionColumnsNov. 24Community ties boost social mobility",https://www.losaltosonline.com/business/existing-home-sales-one-unintended-source-of-housing-unaffordability/article_4e816b05-8840-48fb-b609-68735fc39753.html,"Los Angeles, California, United States",34.0522,-118.244,17,losaltosonline.com

This leads to lower housing starts in any given year.Article content“Removing those barriers and removing any startup costs and any costs that prevent a barrier to entry ultimately would lead to much more supply being in the market. Ultimately, those costs that are put onto the builder end up getting filtered over to the consumer side of things,” Czan said.Article contentHe also said the city, province and federal governments could work together to provide developers with incentives to build more missing middle housing, especially since officials from all three levels of government were reviewing their financial plans for the next year.Article content“Having a focus on those low-rise apartments and medium-density housing units would definitely be a welcome thing that should be considered in the (city, provincial and federal) budgets,” Czan said.Article contentOur website is your destination for up-to-the-minute news, so make sure to bookmark our homepage and

2025-11-11 18:00:00,"The American Dream of buying a home is still alive, but the path to get there looks very different from decades past. Recommended VideoA Coldwell Banker report shared with Fortune shows a staggering 84% of Gen Z say they’re delaying major life milestones like getting married, having children, changing careers, and getting a pet, just to afford to buy a home.Harris Poll surveyed more than 3,000 U.S. adults on behalf of residential and commercial real estate firm Coldwell Banker, and found nearly all Gen Z (97%) and millennials (93%) want to buy a home someday, but the path to homeownership is increasingly difficult due to high home prices, mortgage rates, and other housing costs. “There’s no single fix” to making housing more affordable, Jason Waugh, president of Coldwell Banker Affiliates, told Fortune. Rather, it would take “declining mortgage rates, growing inventory, and moderating price growth.”“Beyond that, state and local programs offering down payment assistance and tax incentives can significantly ease the financial burden for first time buyers,” he added. “Many may qualify for support they’re not yet aware of.”Other recent data confirms just how difficult it’s been for younger generations to break into the housing market: In 2025, the share of first-time home buyers plummeted to a record low of 21%, while the typical age of first-time buyers climbed to an all-time high of 40 years, according to a National Association of Realtors report released last week.“The historically low share of first-time buyers underscores the real-world consequences of a housing market starved for affordable inventory,” Jessica Lautz, NAR deputy chief economist and vice president of research, said in a statement. “The share of first-time buyers in the market has contracted by 50% since 2007—right before the Great Recession.”The Coldwell Banker report also shows 53% of aspiring first-time homeowners don’t expect to buy their first home until they’re at least 40, suggesting milestones like starting families could be pushed back even further.The housing affordability crisisOne of the most frustrating aspects of today’s housing market is hopeful homebuyers can remember the sub-3% mortgage rates of the pandemic era. Now, home rates continue to hover over 6%, and home prices have skyrocketed about 50% in just the past five years, according to the Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index.Meanwhile, Americans need to make about $141,000 to afford a median-priced home, according to a National Association of Home Builders report, but the average salary for a person in the U.S. is about half of that. “The income needed to buy a home in the U.S. “remains significantly higher than before the [COVID-19] pandemic, underscoring the ongoing challenge of affordability even as market conditions gradually rebalance,” Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale previously said in a statement.Gen Z is trying Although the path to homeownership “may be more complex for Gen Z,” Waugh said, they’re also a generation that’s resourceful and determined. Many Gen Zers are taking on side hustles for supplemental income streams, he said, and they’re also considering buying less ideal homes like something smaller of a fixer upper. Some are also moving to more affordable areas, cobuying with family or friends, or moving in with parents to save up to buy a home. Waugh gave an example of a 20-year-old client who chose to forgo college, began working at 17, and spent three years saving while living with his parents to save enough money to buy a house of his own.“This openness to multigenerational living and creative financial strategies suggests that—rather than being unattainable—the American Dream is being redefined by Gen Z to align with evolving economic realities,” Waugh said.",https://time.com/7333027/trump-50-year-mortgage-housing-costs-affordability-interest-rates/,American,39.828175,-98.5795,46,time.com

The United States has an estimated 33,338 zoning jurisdictions, each of which has the power to constrain housing supply and drive up costs. Their authority flows from the states, which, under the 10th Amendment, have the power to enact zoning and land-use regulations. By contrast, the federal government’s power over state and local zoning and land use actions is limited under the Constitution.
Much of what the federal government does is in the form of housing subsidies and bureaucracy. The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s fiscal 2026 budget is $89 billion, with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit costing another $15 billion annually. Since HUD was established in 1965, it has spent trillions, yet housing remains scarce and unaffordable.

It is a common misconception that developers prefer building big homes on large lots because they yield higher profits. In reality, local zoning codes and minimum lot size requirements largely dictate the size of a house and the size of the lot it sits on, not market preferences.
MEDIAN AGE OF US HOMEBUYER RISES TO 40, A RECORD
The American Enterprise Institute Housing Center examined the nearly 11 million single-family detached and 1.1 million single-family attached homes built in new residential subdivisions across the nation from 2000 to 2024 and found that the SFD and SFA lot sizes averaged about 8,000 square feet and 1,900 square feet, respectively. Then we asked a simple question: what if we changed one variable and made those lots smaller? If SFD and SFA lot sizes averaged roughly 5,000 square feet and 1,900 square feet, respectively, and 20% of the SFD lots were used instead for SFA homes, the same amount of land would have yielded 400,000 more homes annually, and the median sales price would have been $66,000 lower.
Our conclusion is simple: The three most important things for housing supply and affordability are smaller lots, smaller lots, smaller lots. To get all 50 states on board, we suggest repurposing 10% or $8.9 billion of HUD’s annual budget as a bounty for small lot single-family construction. This would be enough to provide bounties averaging $35,000 per lot on 250,000 small lot single-family homes per year. The states would be paid for performance — the laboratory of the states would determine how to accomplish this. The private sector would be happy to build on these smaller lots, and the households needing more affordable homes to grow families would benefit. The “Not in My Backyard” generation would have the opportunity to have grandchildren.
Here’s how it might work. A $25,000 bounty would be paid for each new style of home that meets the square feet requirement and is platted or subdivided on or after January 2026 — SFD homes on 5,000 square feet or less, SFA homes on 2,000 square feet or less, and duplex, triplex, or quadplex built on a new lot of 6,000 square feet, 8,000 square feet, and 10,000 square feet or less respectively.
SHOULD THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GRADE EVERY STATE AND CITY ON ITS ZONING RULES?
For new lots within 5 miles of a new manufacturing site certified by the U.S. Department of Commerce to create 500 or more jobs from 2025 to 2030, another $25,000 would be paid on each new SFD or attached home that meets the above requirements. An additional $25,000 bounty to be paid for each new SFD or attached home meeting the above requirements and built on land purchased from the federal government. A maximum of two bounties should be paid per lot.This program would enlist the combined efforts of all levels of government to “Make Starter Homes Great Again.” Economic development needs these homes — they are where jobs go to sleep at night.

Housing AuthorityDepartment of Human ServicesHousing assistanceHomelessnessLease-upsWASHINGTON, D.C. (7News) — Members of the D.C. Council held a public oversight roundtable on Wednesday to discuss the District's housing voucher programs.The District's locally-funded system provides housing vouchers to residents in need to help them pay rent through two programs: Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) and Targeted Affordable Housing (TAH). PSH provides a housing subsidy and supportive services to individuals and
families exiting homelessness, while TAH
is intended for households who need assistance obtaining and affording housing -- most likely due to advanced age
and/or disability.Councilmember Robert C. White, Jr., Chair of the Committee on Housing, and Councilmember Matthew Frumin, Chairperson of the Committee on Human Services, convened the roundtable, which provided oversight on the D.C. Housing Authority (DCHA) and the Department of Human Services (DHS). RELATED | DC property management company sued over housing voucher abuseLast fiscal year, the average wait length from voucher approval to lease approval was 205 days, according to DHS. That's down from 421 days in fiscal year 2023. Those wait times don't include the initial application process to determine eligibility.""In the past two years, we've cut in half the times it's taking the city to get people from homelessness into housing, but we need to continue to do better,"" White told 7News. ""It's still over 200 days. So I like the progress, but I don't want to let this up.""I want to make sure we have our agencies, our nonprofit partners and the people who actually use vouchers and those who rent to them all in the same place, so that nobody's pointing fingers. So we keep pulling everybody to the same table, saying: 'Let's do better.'""More than 45 people signed up to testify, including members of the public and government representatives.At previous oversight hearings on this topic, a number of residents called out how slow the process has been to receive housing assistance. Those concerns were echoed Thursday.“The importance of the improving this, the speed of the voucher process, cannot be overstated,"" Andy Wassenich, policy director for the nonprofit Miriam's Kitchen, testified. ""The positive benefits of making it better are far reaching.”Multiple advocates told councilmembers that better streamlining the multiple steps involved to secure housing can help make for shorter wait times. ""Any little delay in the process just adds length of time,"" Jill Coppick, a PSH manager at Everyone Home DC, told 7News. She said the delays her team is seeing are even higher than the District-wide average, reporting an average 288 days to get housing secured for eligible individuals and an average 471 days for families. Coppick told 7News the president’s executive order aimed at removing homeless encampments in the District further spotlights the issue of getting the homeless into homes more quickly.""When they're getting moved around, the encampments are changing,"" she explained. ""It can delay the process in terms of trying to locate people.""Several voucher recipients spoke about being discriminated against throughout the process, from landlords not wanting to rent to them to communication issues with case managers. “I'm a human, human just like all of you,"" Deaundra Johnson testified. ""I got a voucher, that is it.”“I’ve heard the testimony, I’ve heard the frustration,"" DCHA Executive Director Keith Pettigrew told councilmembers. ""We know some people haven’t been treated as they should’ve and we’re working on that.”DHS Acting Director A.D. Rachel Pierre told councilmembers their goal is to help people access housing within 120 days of being assigned to a case manager, saying they continue to reduce the time it takes to submit a rental application once someone is matched to a case manager.TrendingMan found naked, unconscious after Fairfax County fight later dies: PoliceFairfax County police are investigating a deadly incident after officers responded to a fight early Monday morning.

2025-11-10 18:45:00,"Trump on Saturday posted an image on social that seemed to suggest he would be proposing 50-year mortgages, something FHFA Director Bill Pulte confirmed shortly after on X.
The image Trump posted on Truth Social features a head shot of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt under the title 30-year mortgage, and his own head shot under a title of 50-year mortgage. Pulte then replied: “Thanks to President Trump, we are indeed working on The 50 year Mortgage – a complete game changer.”
As with other official announcements on social posts, there wasn’t a lot of detail provided and nothing has been posted on the White House press page as of this writing.
The president has been focused on the issue of housing affordability throughout his term, leading off on inauguration day with an executive order for emergency price relief in housing. He has also pressured Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates and launched investigations against Fed members and tried to fire them to try to achieve lower rates.
A longer fixed-rate amortization on mortgage loans would lower monthly payments. Using Fannie Mae‘s mortgage loan calculator with a 20% down payment and a mortgage rate of 6.575%, the breakdown below shows payments at different home prices and mortgage terms. This is just for principal and interest and doesn’t include property taxes or insurance. It also assumes the same interest rate for a longer-term loan, which is not a given.
$300,00030-year fixed: $1,529 principal and interest 40-year fixed: $1,418 principal and interest50-year fixed: $1,366 principal and interest
$400,00030-year fixed: $2,038 principal and interest40-year fixed: $1,891 principal and interest 50-year fixed: $1,822 principal and interest
$500,00030-year fixed: $2,548 principal and interest40-year fixed: $2,363 principal and interest50-year fixed: $2,277 principal and interest
While the longer mortgage term does reduce the monthly payment, it also reduces the amount of equity homeowners build and at some point, the savings are minimal — as you see between the 40- and 50-year terms above.
There is also a legal obstacle to a 50-year mortgage. After the great financial crisis, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Consumer Protection Act which made mortgage underwriting stricter. The Qualified Mortgage (QM) rule is part of that legislation and does not currently allow a 40- or 50-year mortgage, so that would have to be changed for this proposal to get widespread adoption. It’s possible that a 50-year mortgage could be offered by lenders as a non-QM mortgage, which typically comes with higher mortgage rates to balance out the risk.
The drop in equity is one reason HousingWire Lead Analyst Logan Mohtashami doesn’t like the idea.
“I understand that we have housing affordability challenges in America, but subsidizing more demand from 30- to 50-year mortgages is not the policy we want to take now. Housing has to balance itself out through slowing home-price growth and wages increasing — as it has for many decades. To add another subsidization to the market just prevents that healing process from occurring, which also prevents less equity build out as well. So I am not a fan of any increasing in the amortization, the 30-year fixed is perfectly fine as is.
“Additionally, a 50-year mortgage is currently illegal under the qualified mortgage law, so that would have to change as well,” Mohtashami said.

2025-11-10 16:15:00,"The Trump administration is moving forward with a plan to introduce a 50-year fixed-rate mortgage, a reform officials believe could make homeownership more feasible for millions of Americans amid soaring prices and mounting affordability concerns.​Recommended Video“Thanks to President Trump, we are indeed working on The 50-year Mortgage – a complete game changer,” Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte said Saturday in a statement released on social media. His announcement came after Trump shared a graphic online comparing his proposal to the 30-year mortgage policies championed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the New Deal.​With 30-year fixed rates remaining stuck above 6% for more than three years, high homeownership costs have kept many would-be homebuyers out of the market. According to Redfin data, the median U.S. household is currently spending approximately 39% of its monthly income on mortgage repayments—well above long-term affordability benchmarks.​Meanwhile, the “lock-in effect” has prevented many prospective sellers from putting their homes on the market because they don’t want to give up the ultra-low rates they secured before borrowing costs jumped in 2022. The result has been housing market gridlock that’s putting ownership out of reach for younger Americans and worsening overall affordability. As buyers seek alternatives amid elevated rates and unprecedented home values, adjustable-rate mortgages are in more demand and now account for 10% or more of mortgage applications, the highest since 2021, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.Pulte has blamed Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, who hiked interest rates to curb inflation but has since resumed easing cautiously, saying on X.com that he is keeping rates “artificially high.”He also said the administration is “laser focused on ensuring the American Dream for YOUNG PEOPLE and that can only happen on the economic level of homebuying. A 50 Year Mortgage is simply a potential weapon in a WIDE arsenal of solutions that we are developing right now. STAY TUNED!” How a 50-year mortgage would work—or notAt its core, the proposed 50-year loan product targets lower monthly payments by extending the standard amortization period. For instance, Fannie Mae’s calculator estimates that, for a $400,000 home at a 6.575% interest rate with 20% down, the monthly principal and interest would be $2,788 on a 30-year fixed, $2,640 for 40 years, and $2,572 for 50 years. ​But critics warn the risks are significant. Extending mortgages to 50 years would increase total interest paid and slow the buildup of home equity, potentially trapping borrowers in debt for a lifetime. Economist Tyler ​Cowen, of the influential blog Marginal Revolution, put the idea into GPT-5 and came back with the takeaway that a government‑backed 50‑year mortgage would “likely lower monthly payments but raise house prices, slow equity build‑up (and raise default risk in downturns), and increase interest‑rate risk in the financial system.” In the short run, this would see sellers and incumbent owners capturing much of the benefit while first‑time buyers face higher entry prices.The situation now is far from optimal, though. The average age of the first-time homebuyer keeps being pushed higher amid the turbulent housing market of the last several years. Recently, the National Association of Realtors found that it was 40 years old in 2025, the highest ever. As ResiClub’s Lance Lambert noted in a statement to Fortune, that means the typical first-time homebuyer is just as close to collecting Social Security as they are to graduating from high school.Pulte floats Fannie, Freddie buying stocksThe 50-year mortgage proposal came amid a flurry of posts from Pulte, a member of one of America’s most prominent homebuilding families, who was fresh off a Friday appearance at ResiDay, a residential real estate conference hosted by ResiClub. Pulte said, without disclosing details, that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would seek to take equity stakes in private-sector companies in a manner similar to the unprecedented deal with Intel months earlier.“We hold all the cards,” Pulte told ResiClub about Fannie and Freddie, which have been under government conservatorship since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008. “[We] will probably take ownership in different companies by virtue of companies offering them equity in exchange for Fannie and Freddie doing smart business constructs with them,” he said, likening it to Intel.",https://www.silive.com/data/2025/11/nyc-housing-affordability-crisis-median-home-prices-hit-new-record-high.html,"Fort Greene, New York, United States",40.6937,-73.9671,46,silive.com

I’m looking forward to seeing the details on exactly where that will happen,” Sutcliffe said at a news conference following the tabling of the budget.Article content“I’ve had several conversations with the prime minister and with members of his cabinet about the unique opportunities we have in Ottawa to invest in housing, to use federal land to build housing.

The removal of the GST for first-time homebuyers’ purchase of a new build under $1 million is a step in the right direction, he said, but it needs to be coupled with supply-oriented solutions.Article content“If you look at what has been built in all the major cities in Canada over the last five years, it’s been a lot of non-market housing.

Around 67 per cent of those surveyed said local housing was unaffordable, and 50 per cent said they doubted they would ever be able to afford to buy homes in their communities of choice.Article contentSixty-two per cent of respondents also said they were worried that they could lose their homes or rental units if their financial situations suddenly changed.Article contentIt’s not just renters and aspiring homebuyers feeling the pinch.Article contentData from the city’s 2024 Housing Needs Assessment also suggested that thousands of homeowners were experiencing heightened vulnerability in the housing market due to soaring mortgage rates and costs. The proportion of homeowners in Ottawa paying $2,000 or more per month for housing costs nearly tripled from 2006 to 2021 (from 11.5 per cent to 34.2 per cent).Article contentMeanwhile, the percentage of homeowners paying between $1,500 and $1,999 per month dipped from 20.4 per cent in 2006 to 17.8 per cent in 2021.Article content“Families are being priced out,” Czan said.Article contentThere may be some relief coming in the future. A report by the CMHC in July suggested that Ottawa saw an annual increase in average advertised rent prices, but at a slower pace.Article contentAccording to the City of Ottawa’s housing approvals dashboard, 13,662 housing starts were reported between the first quarter of 2023 and the fourth quarter of 2024.Article contentThe CMHC also said 9,000 rental apartments were currently under construction in Ottawa, setting a record for the city.Article contentThe sheer amount of housing approvals, along with slower population growth, will cause rental prices to fall in the future.Article contentBut Czan said more collaboration needed to happen between all levels of government to address the housing affordability crisis and reduce barriers to buying a home.Article contentArticle content“Collaboration amongst all levels of government would be something that would be positively viewed by our association and many other associations in real estate,” he said.Article content“Any measures that could help fill the gap in terms of missing middle housing would definitely be a welcome move for our marketplace.”Article contentHe said, for example, the City of Ottawa should remove development charges because they were a roadblock for developers wanting to build more housing. This leads to lower housing starts in any given year.Article content“Removing those barriers and removing any startup costs and any costs that prevent a barrier to entry ultimately would lead to much more supply being in the market. Ultimately, those costs that are put onto the builder end up getting filtered over to the consumer side of things,” Czan said.Article contentHe also said the city, province and federal governments could work together to provide developers with incentives to build more missing middle housing, especially since officials from all three levels of government were reviewing their financial plans for the next year.Article content“Having a focus on those low-rise apartments and medium-density housing units would definitely be a welcome thing that should be considered in the (city, provincial and federal) budgets,” Czan said.Article contentOur website is your destination for up-to-the-minute news, so make sure to bookmark our homepage and

(KCTV) - Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte announced Saturday on X that he is working on a plan to facilitate 50-year mortgages to make home ownership more affordable. He called it a “game changer” and credited President Donald Trump with the idea.But financial experts in Kansas City told KCTV the longer loan terms would cost more than they help, and the real solution is to increase housing inventory.Aubrey Washington, a senior mortgage banker at Flat Branch Home Loans, said the savings are minimal compared to the long-term costs.“The first thing I thought was, it’s a distraction. It’s a distraction from the overall problem, which is affordability in our country,” Washington said. “I think the optics of what people think it’s going to save sounds like a lot more than it is once you actually dive into the numbers.”Washington calculated those numbers for a $300,000 house, assuming a 6.25% interest rate for a 30-year mortgage and a 6.75% rate for a 50-year mortgage. In that scenario, the 50-year mortgage results in a monthly payment that is about $100 less. But it also results in paying nearly $400,000 more in interest over the life of the loan.Washington said potential buyers are wiser to cut $100 out of their spending if the only barrier is $100 per month.“It’s like the cost of a nitro brew at Starbucks a day. That is the equivalent of what this is going to save you per month,” Washington said.Housing supply remains the core issueWashington said a better solution would be to create incentives for builders to address the housing shortage.“We’re years behind in inventory,” she said. “It’s like a gridlock in housing.”Without increasing supply, adding more potential buyers to the same housing market would likely drive prices higher.Mike Decker, a fiduciary advisor at Kedrec Wealth in Overland Park and author of “How to Retire on Time,” said 50-year mortgages are not a solution for the market or buyers.“It just kind of exacerbates the underlying issue,” Decker said.He said the extended loan terms mean buyers would essentially rent from the bank for decades before building equity.“Another way to look at a 50-year mortgage, because you’re mostly paying interest, is basically you’re renting from the bank for probably 20 or 30 years, and then you start paying down the mortgage. I mean, it’s really not in your favor,” Decker said.Budget considerations for potential buyersDecker said buyers who need that $100 monthly savings to afford a house may have budgets too tight for homeownership until they earn more or spend less.“You can’t just force affordability. It doesn’t work that way. So, you have to figure out what you have control over and work within those parameters,” he said.Washington advises clients to review six months or credit or debit card statements to see how much spending is unnecessary.“Your Amazon purchases, your smoothies, your coffee. All these little things add up,” she said.For buyers priced out by small amounts, Decker and Washington suggest researching federal and state first-time homebuyer assistance programs that can help with down payments. They are typically dependent on income and credit score.Decker also suggested looking at more than just interest rates but all costs. He said sometimes buyers can come out ahead by picking a slightly higher interest rate with lower closing costs.Copyright 2025 KCTV.

White House’s 50-year mortgage proposal draws heavy criticism
The Associated Press//November 12, 2025//
Listen to this article
The Blueprint
The White House is considering a 50-year mortgage to improve housing affordability.
Economists say the plan won’t fix issues like limited housing supply or high rates.
Borrowers could pay nearly $389,000 more in interest than with a 30-year loan.
Critics note most Americans wouldn’t live long enough to pay off a 50-year mortgage.
NEW YORK — The White House says it is considering backing a 50-year mortgage to help alleviate the home affordability crisis in the country. But the announcement drew immediate criticism from policymakers, social media and economists, who said a 50-year mortgage would do little to resolve other core problems in the housing market, such as a lack of supply and high interest rates.
Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said on X over the weekend that a 50-year mortgage would be “a complete game changer” for homebuyers. FHFA is the part of the federal government that oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which buy and insure the vast majority of mortgages in the country.
The 30-year mortgage is a uniquely American financial product and the default way to buy a home since the New Deal. Politicians and policymakers at the time wanted to create a standardized mortgage that borrowers could afford and pay off during their working years, when the average lifespan for an American was 66 years old.
Lower payment
Extending the life of a mortgage to 50 years does decrease a borrower’s monthly payment.
The average selling price of a home in the U.S. was $415,200 in September, according to National Association of Realtors. Assuming a standard 10% down payment and an average interest rate of 6.17%, the monthly payment on a 30-year mortgage would be $2,288 while the payment on a 50-year mortgage would be $2,022. That’s presuming a bank would not require a higher interest rate on a 50-year mortgage, due to the longer duration of the loan.
But significantly higher interest
Because even more of the monthly payment on a 50-year mortgage would go toward interest on the loan, it would take 30 years before a borrower would accumulate $100,000 in equity, not including home price appreciation and the down payment. That’s compared to 12-13 years to accumulate $100,000 in equity when paying off a 30-year mortgage, excluding the down payment.
A borrower would pay, roughly, an additional $389,000 in interest over the life of a 50-year mortgage compared to a 30-year mortgage, according to an AP analysis.
Other analysts came to a similar conclusion.
“Extending a mortgage from 30 years to 50 years could double the [dollar] amount of interest paid by the homebuyer on a median priced home over the life of the loan and significantly slow equity accumulation,” wrote John Lovallo with UBS Securities.
Broader housing issues
A 50-year mortgage does nothing to solve one critical issue when it comes to housing affordability — the lack of supply of homes. States like California and cities like New York have recently passed legislation or made regulatory changes to allow builders to build homes faster with less regulatory red tape.
There’s also the raw cost of homebuilding in the country. Products such as steel, lumber, concrete, copper and plastics that go into home construction are now subject to tariffs under President Trump. Further, many construction jobs were being done by undocumented workers, particularly in the Southwest, where deportations are impacting the ability for homebuilders to find enough labor to build homes.
“Many of the big things that would address supply right now are going in the wrong direction,” said Mike Konczal, senior director of policy and research at the Economic Security Project.”
Pulte said on X that the introduction of a 50-year mortgage was just a “potential weapon,” among other solutions the White House has considered to combat high housing prices.
Americans don’t live long enough
The average age of a first-time homebuyer has been creeping up for years and is now roughly 40 years of age. A 50-year mortgage would be difficult to underwrite for a bank for a 40-year-old first-time homebuyer, who would be 90 years old by the time that home is paid off. The average life expectancy of an American is now roughly 79 years, meaning there’s 11 years of life expectancy not covered in a 50-year loan.
“It’s typically not a goal of policymakers to pass on mortgage debt to a borrowers’ children,” Konczal said.
Others have tried longer loans
Other parts of the financial system have extended loan terms, to mixed results. The seven-year auto loan has become increasingly common as car prices have risen and Americans keep their cars longer. Despite longer loan terms, auto loan delinquencies have been rising, and the average price of a new car is now $49,740 compared to a price of $38,948 for a new vehicle five years ago.
Student loans were originally designed to be paid off in 10 years, and now there are multiple payment options that extend repayment out to 20 years.
Economists pointed out that a 50-year mortgage may do the opposite of helping with home affordability by causing home price inflation by introducing more potential buyers into a market struggling with supply.
Trump downplays idea
After significant criticism, President Trump seemed less enthused about the 50-year mortgage. When asked by Laura Ingraham of Fox News about the idea, President Trump said it “might help a little bit” but seemed to brush it off.
Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac cannot insure a mortgage that is longer than 30 years, so any 50-year mortgage would be considered a “non-qualifying mortgage” and would be more difficult to sell to investors. Congress would have to amend U.S. financial laws in multiple places to allow for 50-year mortgages, and there seems to be little appetite for Congress to take this on immediately.

This category, Expanding Development and Affordability, features five finalists in the NewDEAL Ideas Challenge 2025.

Vacant Property Initiative
Lead Author: Jon Mitchell, Mayor – New Bedford, MA
Category: Building & Development / Economic Opportunity & Affordability

The Challenge
The city of New Bedford faces a persistent housing-and-neighborhood challenge: with limited buildable land and high costs and long timelines for new construction, bottlenecks in housing supply and under-utilised properties exacerbate neighborhood decline. Recognizing this, the Vacant Property Initiative was launched to tackle the inventory of unused or legally entangled parcels that are dragging down communities.

The Solution
The initiative zeroes in on vacant and under-utilised properties as a faster, more cost-effective way to restore housing supply, reduce blight and strengthen neighborhoods. Key components include:

Hiring a dedicated Vacant Property Development Manager to coordinate interventions like probate assistance, receivership, tax-foreclosure support and owner outreach.
Forming an inter-departmental Vacant Property Working Group across housing, code enforcement, inspectional services and treasurer’s divisions. 
Deploying a data-driven toolset: a Vacant Building Registry enhanced with a custom ESRI-based property-analysis dashboard drawing on municipal systems to provide a full snapshot of property condition, ownership status, liens, and vacancy indicators. 

Why It Matters
By shifting the focus from only new construction to actively reclaiming existing vacant assets, New Bedford’s approach offers multiple benefits: reclaiming neglected properties, stabilising neighborhoods, improving housing availability and recovering tax revenue. Already, the city is recouping over $1 million in tax revenue and fines within the first eighteen months of the initiative.

Impact & Measurement
Metrics for the program include:

Tracking properties from vacancy to occupancy or active rehabilitation via the dashboard. 
Fiscal returns: more than $1 million in recovered tax revenue and fines in the first 18 months.
Community outcomes: cases moved out of extended vacancy, legal resolution of estates, and redemption of properties otherwise stuck in limbo.

Infrastructure and Housing Impact Fund
Lead Author: Michael Frerichs, Treasurer – Illinois, IL
Category: Economic Opportunity & Affordability

The Challenge
Housing and infrastructure serve as the backbone of thriving communities, yet investment in these sectors has declined across the country. At the same time, many regions face serious affordable-housing shortages and growing infrastructure demands—especially as emerging technologies place new stresses on energy, utilities and the built environment.

The Solution
Treasurer Frerichs launched the FIRST Fund — a $1.5 billion impact investment vehicle dedicated to strengthening Illinois’ infrastructure and housing markets. Key features:

The fund is the first infrastructure-investment fund in a state treasury in Illinois. 
Target: invest $1.5 billion to bridge the gap between development demand and available financing. 
The fund invests up to 5% of the state’s investment portfolio, with about $250 million deployed annually in projects ranging from $25 million to $75 million. 
Projects focus on revenue-producing housing and infrastructure developments that deliver direct benefits to Illinois citizens.
Emphasis on underserved communities: since launching in 2023, $490 million invested in total, with 64 % ($315 million) allocated to firms owned by minority, women, veteran and disabled asset managers. The underlying fund managers have invested roughly $2.1 billion into Illinois—about 4.3 times the state’s $490 million contribution. 

Why It Matters
By deploying state-level capital into housing and infrastructure finance, the fund addresses two core bottlenecks: inadequate housing supply (especially affordable housing) and aging or insufficient infrastructure capacity. The model repositions the public-treasury role from passive investment to proactive, community-driven economic growth and local wealth creation. It aligns financial returns with measurable public and social benefit, offering a blueprint for other states.

Impact & Measurement
Performance metrics are built directly into the fund’s framework:

Total capital invested and multiplier effect: $490 million invested by the fund since launch, supporting $2.1 billion total investment in Illinois (approx. 4.3×).
Proportion of funding to firms owned by traditionally under-represented groups: 64 % of the $490 million has been directed to minority, women, veteran, and disabled asset-managers.
Future tracking will include decreases in housing-supply deficits and the gap between energy/infrastructure capacity and demand, to validate the fund’s direct impact on community conditions.

Innovative State Financing for Affordable Homeownership Development
Lead Author: Dylan Roberts, State Senator – Colorado, CO
Category: Building & Development / Economic Opportunity & Affordability

The Challenge
Affordable homeownership remains out of reach for many low- and moderate-income households. Standard financing models often leave too little margin for builders and sellers to profitably offer homes at lower price points, driving up costs and limiting the supply of homes that qualified buyers can afford.

The Solution
Senator Roberts’ bill creates a new tool through the Colorado State Treasurer: the state will invest in bonds issued by quasi-governmental agencies at below-market returns to finance the construction of affordable, for-sale homes. These homes will have permanent or long-term resale restrictions, and the financing structure is designed so that once constructed, the owner converts the construction loan into a 30-year conventional mortgage at a below-market rate. Because of the structure, buyers gain roughly 33 % more purchasing power.

Why It Matters
This financing innovation reduces the cost of construction and enables builders to offer homes at prices affordable to first-time and moderate-income buyers—without sacrificing long-term affordability or resale protections. By expanding homeownership access, the initiative strengthens households, neighborhoods and local economies in a model that could be replicated across states.

Impact & Measurement

A pilot program was seeded with $50 million in initial investment.
Metrics to be tracked: number of homes built through the program; increase in affordability relative to conventional homes; conversion of construction loans into long-term mortgages; and buyer demographics (income, first-generation status, etc.).

Expanding Affordable Housing Through Accessory Dwelling Units
Lead Author: Nicole Clowney, State Representative – Fayetteville, AR
Category: Building & Development / Economic Opportunity & Affordability

The Challenge
Many communities nationwide are facing an affordable-housing crisis, with rapidly rising home costs making it difficult for middle- and lower-income families to find suitable housing. In some counties, home prices have surged by 65 % or more in the past five years, further limiting options for those who earn less.

The Solution
This initiative leverages the potential of Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs)—small secondary housing units such as backyard cottages, converted garages or nanny flats—to expand affordable housing supply on existing properties. The policy advances major reforms including:

Granting every landowner on a single-family lot the right to build one ADU. 
Limiting municipalities from imposing excessive impact fees or use permits for ADU construction.
Streamlining the development process to remove bureaucratic obstacles and make ADU development more accessible. 
Besides boosting supply, ADUs give homeowners more flexibility—providing rental income or housing for family members—while preserving neighborhood character and making efficient use of existing infrastructure. 

Why It Matters
By empowering homeowners to create affordable “in-law” or secondary units on their property, this approach supports housing affordability without requiring large-scale new construction. ADUs bring multiple benefits: increasing rental unit supply, generating income for homeowners (especially older adults), and using infrastructure already in place—all while maintaining the feel of single-family neighborhoods.

Impact & Measurement
Implementation will be monitored in partnership with the state’s Municipal League. Metrics tracked will include the number of ADUs built and identifying municipal obstacles that remain in the way of widespread ADU development.

Leveraging Public Land for Workforce Housing
Lead Author: County Supervisor – Santa Barbara, CA
Category: Building & Development / Housing

The Challenge
Communities across the United States are grappling with an affordable housing crisis: many people simply cannot afford to live where they work. In one county, over a one-year analysis of more than 6,000 acres of publicly-owned land, leadership identified sites such as a former government office building and a county-campus parking lot as high-potential for workforce housing.
Because land acquisition drives up costs and constrains speed of development, publicly-owned under-used buildings, vacant lots and idle parcels represent a missed opportunity.

The Solution
This initiative focuses on unlocking under-utilized public land in developed areas for affordable housing targeted at the local workforce. Key elements include:

Identifying publicly-owned parcels (including buildings, parking lots and vacant lots) in prime locations for affordable workforce housing. 
Removing the cost of land acquisition from the development equation to reduce housing costs and enable faster delivery.
Prioritizing residents who work in the community—such as food workers, school employees, young people and older adults—so they can live where they work. 
Preserving agricultural land and open space by building on already-developed public land rather than expanding into undeveloped parcels. 

Why It Matters
Using government-owned land as a housing asset shifts the paradigm: rather than idle public parcels draining value, they become catalysts for workforce-housing solutions. This approach aligns housing access with local jobs, supports community stability, and protects open spaces by focusing on infill rather than greenfield development.

Impact & Measurement

Land-use conversion: tracking how many publicly-owned parcels are repurposed for workforce housing.
Affordability and occupancy: measuring the number of units built affordable to local workers and filled by those residents. 
Preservation of open land: quantifying acres of agricultural or open land spared because housing was built on public sites.

2025-11-08 21:15:00,"A data-driven analysis of investor ownership, housing supply constraints and mortgage access in metro Atlanta.
Executive Summary
While the presence of corporate ownership in the single-family housing market is increasingly central in the affordability debate, the data regarding their direct impact on rising home prices are disputable. Popular discussion of institutional investors features inconsistent definitions and benchmarks, which complicates analysis of their market impact. Narratives on this topic are also confusing and undefined. Specific examples include conflating the percentage of corporate investor-owned single-family rentals with the total percentage of single-family rental homes, while the specifications of what exactly constitutes an institutional investor remain undefined and lead to analytical inconsistencies.
Institutional investors have faced increased scrutiny from policymakers in recent years, with both federal and state lawmakers attempting to restrict their activities. With this heightened focus on their behavior in metro Atlanta, the Georgia Public Policy Foundation sought to examine and bring clarity to this issue. Our review found the following:
Despite ambiguity in how exactly institutional investors are defined, it is reasonable to conclude that metro Atlanta has the highest concentration of institutional investor owned housing of any metropolitan area in the United States.
The number of investor-owned homes in metro Atlanta peaked from 2014-2017, as the housing market recovered from the Great Recession and the subsequent decline of Georgia’s homebuilding and community banking industries. In all 12 of the metro Atlanta counties that were analyzed, the owner-occupancy rate has increased since 2017.
While the presence of investors has correlated with short-time price movements, such movements are usually driven by broader housing market dynamics. One of these dynamics is the artificial suppression of new housing stock through excessive regulation, which prevents industry from responding to higher prices and unmet demand by creating more supply.
The increased presence of investor-owned housing in metro Atlanta had a limited measurable impact on home prices in the period from 2000 to 2024. While this period does include the stabilization of cratering home prices in the wake of the Great Recession, the highest recorded concentration of investor-owned housing did not correlate with home prices above historical benchmarks.
Lastly, analysis of financing and lending on housing affordability in recent years has primarily focused on the Federal Reserve’s decision to raise interest rates from March 2022-July 2023. Less attention has been paid to the impact of lending reforms in the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 on potential borrowers, in which Qualified Mortgage standards have effectively locked out a majority of Americans from being able to secure the necessary financing to purchase a home.
Roughly 65 percent of mortgages that originate in the United States now belong to borrowers with superprime (considered 760 and above) credit scores. This is particularly detrimental for younger borrowers, who often lack the credit score needed to qualify for a mortgage.
Introduction
As many Americans feel the effects of rising housing prices, lawmakers are beginning to take notice and offer solutions. One popular topic over the past few years has been the buying of properties by “institutional investors.” This term is usually a catch-all for private equity firms, real estate investment trusts, hedge funds and other large corporations that make bulk purchases of homes and properties with the intention to rent them.
A common claim made by frustrated constituents and lawmakers–and a common motivation for legislation that targets investor activity–is that large, out-of-state corporations are buying up too many properties. In turn, critics say, this activity limits access to housing which is affordable as investors outbid consumers for homes on the market or raise rental costs to an extent that disadvantages tenants with unfair practices. This claim seems to have bipartisan appeal, but investors’ real impact on the housing market is debatable and merits further examination. This report will examine the data and assess the prevalence of institutional investors in the metro Atlanta market, as well as the shift in federal regulations in the wake of the Great Recession that led to an increase in single-family rentals.
Institutional investors and public policy
During the 2025 legislative session, Georgia lawmakers in both parties sought to limit investor ownership in the state.
The “Georgians First Residential Property Protection Act” (House Bill 555), introduced by Rep. Derrick McCollum (R‑Chestnut Mountain), would prohibit corporate entities from owning an interest in more than 2,000 single-family residential properties or 10 multifamily residential properties. It would also enforce sales penalties if those limits were exceeded.
The “Protect the Dream Act” (House Bill 305), introduced by Rep. Phil Olaleye (D‑Atlanta), would limit investment funds that owned over $6.25 million in assets or 25 single-family homes in one county from buying additional property in Georgia. The bill’s author blamed such institutions for higher costs of living and the crowding out of vulnerable communities.
Beyond directly limiting their economic activity, lawmakers also introduced bills to more closely regulate institutional investors. Notably, the only bill on this topic to become law was House Bill 399, introduced by Rep. Mary Oliver (D‑Decatur), which required out‑of‑state landlords to employ a local broker or property manager to handle tenant issues. House Bill 374, introduced by Rep. Martin Momtahan (R‑Dallas), would have created a public registry logging corporate landlords who own at least 10 contiguous rental units.
Institutional investors in Georgia have also earned the attention of lawmakers at the federal level, including both of Georgia’s U.S. senators. Sen. Jon Ossoff launched an investigation of several large, out-of-state investors, which he claims “are buying up homes and pushing Georgia homebuyers out of the market.” Sen. Raphael Warnock’s “Stop Predatory Investing Act” would prohibit investors with 50 or more single-family rentals from claiming tax deductions for interest or depreciation on those properties. It also includes tax incentives for investors who sell their units to individual homebuyers or nonprofits.
The government’s response to the presence of these investors in the decade and a half since the global financial crisis remains haphazard. In 2017, Fannie Mae backed a 10-year, $1 billion loan to Invitation Homes, one of the largest investors in single-family rental housing, while Freddie Mac launched a pilot program designed to provide liquidity and stability for mid-sized investors and uniform credit standards on loans for single-family rental properties. Ultimately, the Federal Housing Finance Agency directed both agencies to end these programs in 2018 after concluding that large investors did not require such support.
While HB 399 was the only of the aforementioned state bills to make it out of the House, and the Stop Predatory Investing Act has not advanced beyond the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, institutional investors are increasingly central to the housing policy debate in Georgia and beyond.
Defining institutional investors
Efforts to measure the impacts of institutional investors are frequently complicated by inconsistencies in defining them. Most of the public policy conversation around institutional investors is, in practice, focused on activity in the single-family rental (SFR) market. In addition to different quantitative benchmarks, public discourse often employs a wide and inconsistent set of labels to describe institutional activity in the SFR space.
Terms like “institutional investors,” “out-of-state homebuyers,” “corporate landlords,” “hedge funds,” “private equity” and “real estate investment trusts” are used almost interchangeably in this context. But these labels are not synonymous, and many refer to different types of entities, investment vehicles and stages of involvement in the housing market. For example, a publicly traded investment trust that acquires and manages thousands of homes operates differently from a private equity fund that capitalizes a third-party operator, yet both are frequently grouped under the same umbrella in public debate. This lack of precision further complicates assessing the scale and nature of institutional participation and comparisons of findings across studies. (It is also worth noting that virtually every rental home–i.e., any home not occupied by its owner–is by definition “investor owned.” Because the validity of rental properties generally is not in question, the issue essentially comes down to whether the distinction between “investor owned” and “institutional investor owned” even matters in the marketplace.)
In a 2025 report, “Housing Affordability and the Role of Institutional Investors,” the Texas Conservative Coalition Research Institute (TCCRI) compiled a few varying definitions:
A 2018 study of Atlanta by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) defined “large corporate landlords” as owning more than 15 single-family rental properties. For comparison, Harvard’s Joint Center for Housing Studies considers investors with at least 100 properties to be “large,” and an Urban Land Institute report defines “institutional” investors as those that own at least 2,000 homes.
Freddie Mac defines small investors as owning one to nine properties, medium investors as owning 10 to 99 properties and institutional investors as owning more than 100.
HUD’s Office of Policy Development and Research established definitions as small (one to nine units), medium (10 to 99 units), large (100 to 999) and institutional (more than 1,000) investors based on the number of units in their respective portfolios.
Thus, while it is common to see investors categorized based on the number of properties or units owned, there is little consensus as to what those benchmarks should be. In a more qualitative definition, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority defines institutional investors as “professional investors who pool together capital…and invest on behalf of others, typically at much higher volumes than retail investors.”
The lack of a consensus definition is just one factor that makes it difficult to collect a conclusive body of research on the effects of institutional investment on the housing market. In the context of nationwide housing shortages, the measurable impact of institutional investors is mixed.
These discrepancies are important to point out when referencing cities with relatively high market shares of institutional investors. Atlanta is frequently cited as the metro area with the largest amount of investor activity in the country. The data also reflect this when reviewing metro Atlanta’s institutional investor-owned housing stock compared to other large metropolitan areas across the United States. However, reporting on ownership rates in metro Atlanta’s single-family housing market varies depending on how “institutional investor” is defined and what is being measured. For example, a recent analysis by the American Enterprise Institute estimated institutional investors’ presence at 4.2 percent across the metro area. That report defined institutional ownership as entities holding 100 or more homes and measured ownership as a share of the overall housing stock. Taking a different approach to the subject, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution has noted that investors control roughly 30 percent of metro Atlanta’s single-family rental stock. The AJC’s accounting of investor presence used different parameters for what counts as an institutional investor and a much smaller pool of homes (single-family rentals as opposed to total housing stock, which AEI measured). Such a wide contrast in framing the issue highlights how different methodologies, definitions and scopes of study can produce different impressions of the scale of investor activity.
By most definitions, however, investor presence tends to be most consistently high in the Sunbelt. Cities like Atlanta, Charlotte, Jacksonville, Dallas and Houston consistently receive attention from policymakers and the media for their relatively high share. For example, the AEI report notes that Invitation Homes, which holds a portfolio of over 85,000 homes for lease, operates “in markets with strong demand drivers, high barriers to entry and high rent growth potential, primarily in the Western United States, Florida and the Southeast United States,” per the company’s 10-K report.
This geographic concentration reflects broader demographic and economic trends. The Sunbelt has experienced rapid population growth over the past few decades, driven by a combination of domestic migration, job growth, relatively affordable housing (at least historically) and a temperate climate. Many households relocating from higher-cost regions are seeking single-family homes in growing metros where new construction has not fully kept pace with demand. This influx, combined with the regulatory environment, puts pressure on both for-sale and rental markets, creating conditions like those referenced by Invitation Homes in its annual financial report.
Investors and housing prices
In the years following the Great Recession, investors (of all sizes) acquired a significant number of single-family homes, often through bulk purchases of foreclosed properties. This dynamic was even facilitated by the federal government, with financial backing offered by the Federal Housing Finance Agency to institutional investors from 2012-2018 through its REO-to-Rental Initiative. This program included the $1 billion loan to Invitation Homes referenced earlier in this report. While these acquisitions helped to stabilize a distressed housing market, tighter supply and higher prices are often attributed to the rise of institutional investors during this period.
In 2024, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a congressionally requested report on institutional investment. This synthesis of prior research is frequently cited by media outlets and policymakers, and it is an acknowledgement of the issue’s significance as a national policy concern. In the findings of multiple studies reviewed in the report, institutional investor activity after the Great Recession was correlated with higher home prices, though the impact and implications of this effect varied. Some research found that bulk purchases of foreclosed properties stabilized neighborhoods by boosting demand in distressed markets, while others emphasized that investors’ long-term removal of properties from the for-sale market tightened supply and contributed to broader price appreciation.
Some research also noted benefits in the form of expanded access to professionally managed single-family rentals, particularly for households unable to secure mortgages. As alluded to in the previous section, definitions of institutional investors varied from companies owning more than 50 homes to any explicitly corporate entity that purchased even a single property.
The GAO report also compiled research on the effect that investors have on rent prices, the decision to rent vs. home ownership, and tenant conditions. The authors note that these effects are less clear due in part to a lack of a clear definition of an institutional investor. These mixed results also point to the challenge of isolating investor activity from the broader housing market forces that shape both prices and affordability.
Taken together, these studies suggest that while the prevalence of institutional investors can correlate with short-term price movements, it generally reflects broader housing market dynamics rather than driving them. Investors tend to follow underlying conditions such as strong demand and limited supply or favorable financing, though they may amplify these trends by bidding up prices in tight markets or providing liquidity in distressed ones. The presence of institutional investors can intensify local outcomes, but the direction of housing costs is still determined by fundamental factors like population movement, construction costs, interest rates and land-use policies.
Importantly, much of the existing literature is relevant to the aftermath of the Great Recession, when investors placed a floor under collapsing home prices by purchasing distressed properties. In that context, investor activity acted as a stabilizing force, helping prices recover after bottoming out at about 40 percent of their 2001 benchmark level in 2012. The present market is the inverse. Rather than a surplus of foreclosures and falling home values, housing supply is historically tight and prices continue to climb. The share of purchases by institutional investors peaked in the earlier environment, and the same dynamic once viewed as stabilizing is now seen by many as intensifying affordability challenges. This contrast underscores the need to consider investor activity not only in terms of who is buying and how much, but also in terms of how market context changes the effect of institutional buying.
Investors and the housing shortage
It is important to view investors’ effects on the housing market in the proper context. Their share of ownership in the market varies around the country, and their impact often pales in comparison to that of other economic factors. However, there are ways in which investor ownership can both exacerbate and alleviate housing shortages.
One frequently cited concern centers on investors’ ability to buy large quantities of homes: that when institutional investors, which have greater capital to make bulk purchases, turn properties into long-term rentals, it shrinks the housing stock available for potential buyers by diverting housing that could otherwise enter the for-sale market. This is also posited as one way in which projects backed by institutional capital, such as build-to-rent (BTR) developments, can lead to increases in home prices where supply is either rising or stable.
However, BTR does not shrink the housing stock; by definition, the practice of building neighborhoods of single-family homes to rent directly adds to housing stock. Even when investors convert purchased properties into single-family rentals, they are often responding to demand from households that, for a number of lifestyle, financial or mobility reasons, prefer to rent. The desire to live in a better school district is one frequent example of this. A reallocation of units between tenure types, as opposed to a reduction of the physical stock of housing, means the net effect on supply is neutral, and the consequences of such a reallocation depends on the type of shortage in a given area.
While greater purchasing power can grant institutional investors considerable influence over the housing market, their effect on the market is not always negative. Institutional investors have been shown to alleviate housing shortages in some contexts.
A robust study published in May 2025 by New York University professor Joshua Coven detailed the effects of investor entry into the housing market where households, small landlords and construction can respond. A common misconception on the topic is that institutional investors make bulk purchases with the intention of keeping a majority of homes purchased off the market and vacant in order to drive up the rental prices of other homes in their portfolio. However, Coven’s study found that institutional investors instead tend to increase rental supply and lower rent costs overall. That is because the efficiencies from managing large portfolios outweigh the incentive to use market power to decrease the number of homes available for rent. While reducing the number of homes available for purchase raises home prices, the impact on homeownership is one-fifth of what it would be without the added rental supply, and the price impact is much lower than the observed association between investor purchases and actual price increases. This is an important distinction between correlation (investors buy homes in expensive or growing areas) and causation (investors are the main reason for price increases).
The study also found that institutional rentals attract tenants from lower-income areas with weaker schools and less economic mobility, offering them more neighborhood choices. These results suggest that institutional investors can benefit renters and current homeowners, but can make buying harder for prospective homeowners.
According to Coven, most of the link between institutional investors and housing cost increases comes from the tendency for investors to choose areas already likely to see rising prices and rents, not from their direct market influence. It further warns that using public policy mechanisms to remove such investors would actually raise rents by reducing rental supply.
Similar findings were published in February 2025 by the American Action Forum. AAF concluded that institutional investors have expanded rental supply, which drove down rents while enabling lower income families to move to previously inaccessible areas. AAF also noted that investors tended to improve the quality of existing housing and add liquidity to markets experiencing shortages.
The importance of rental supply is amplified considering how the current lending environment has affected potential homebuyers’ ability to qualify for mortgages. High interest rates and the limited creation of new housing stock have kept many people, especially first-time homebuyers and young families, from transitioning into homeownership, thereby extending their reliance on the rental market.
Institutional investors in metro Atlanta
The scale of investors’ impact depends on a number of economic and geographic factors, and one of the most intuitive is their market share of properties and units owned. As previously mentioned, metro Atlanta is consistently reported to have the largest concentration in the nation, which is a reason for the issue’s prevalence in Georgia and the South. Data compiled by the housing analytics firm John Burns Research and Consulting in July 2025 concluded that Atlanta had the largest share of single-family rental home stock owned by institutional investors (defined as owning 100 or more properties) at 27.9 percent, four times the national average.
Parcl Labs in 2023 published research about the presence of “large operators,” defined as those owning 1,000 or more units, and found that “13.3 percent of large operators’ total portfolios concentrated in [metro Atlanta’s] housing market.” This is more than double the second-closest market, 5.4 percent in Dallas, Texas. With investors’ share of metro Atlanta’s housing market this high, it is reasonable to infer that the effects of their presence may be amplified and more visible than in other areas.
Metro Atlanta’s concentration of institutional ownership helps explain why academic and political scrutiny has centered on a set of major firms that contribute to this trend. Part of Coven’s study focuses on seven major institutional investors: Invitation Homes, American Homes for Rent, Tricon Residential (now owned by Blackstone Inc.), Progress Residential, FirstKey Homes, Main Street Renewal and Home Partners of America. Four of these companies, Invitation Homes, Main Street Renewal, Progress Residential and Tricon Residential, were part of Sen. Ossoff’s investigation referenced earlier. These investors owned 0.17 percent of national housing stock in February 2021 and 5.4 percent of the stock in Paulding County at the same time. Coven notes that “the specific location choices suggest that institutional investors are more likely to have a local impact on U.S. cities, rather than a broad impact on the whole country, and that their investment strategy is highly dependent on geography.”
However, appropriate framing of available data is important if policymakers and advocates intend to address the root causes of housing problems. The negative impact of institutional investors–supposing that buying vs. renting is the zero-sum game its critics perceive it is–typically amounts to amplifying the effects of underlying supply constraints. Paulding County is a useful example of where pressure from population growth meets constraints on supply. Zoning regulations, lot size minimums and other development requirements limit the county’s capacity to build. While having one of the fastest-growing populations in Georgia, Paulding County currently experiences increased home prices, weakening home sales and a decline in the issuance of building permits. Local policies that restrict new development also unintentionally heighten market pressure, which creates conditions that attract outside investors while limiting the supply response that could offset their impact.
Institutional investors and homeownership rates
While the definition of investor-owned housing may vary (small, medium, large, institutional), one economic indicator that can provide us with guidance on the prevalence of homes being rented is owner-occupancy. The U.S. Census Bureau collects data on how many homes are occupied by their owners. Owner-occupancy provides an important control variable in examining homeownership within a community, especially over an extended period of time in comparison to those on the rental market. All else being equal, if the owner-occupancy rate in an area is holding steady, then we might conclude that institutional investors are simply buying properties that smaller investors otherwise would have owned–rather than preventing people from becoming homeowners. One oft-cited example of this is the offloading of short-term rentals by “mom and pop” investors as vacation rentals declined during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.
It is important to note there are also distinctions in the method in which owner-occupancy data can be displayed. Homeownership rates are frequently displayed either as a percentage of housing units occupied by their owner, or as the percentage of residents in a community who live in owner-occupied housing, i.e., two parents and three kids equates to five residents in owner-occupied housing (as a percentage of total population). For the purposes of this study, we rely on the Census methodology which relies on housing units.
In the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) in the chart below, collected and published by Kevin Erdmann, senior affiliated scholar at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, we can examine the homeownership rate in metro Atlanta. Notably, this chart also compares homeownership rates with the home price index of both the highest and lowest tiered price homes in the Atlanta MSA from 2000-present. On the left side of the chart, home prices from March 2001 (red and black lines) are used as the benchmark for the index. The right side of the chart indicates the percentage of homes which are owner-occupied (blue line).
As Erdmann observes, “the large push of institutional ownership happened in the mid-2010s … that’s when homeownership rates were declining in Georgia. For much of that time, home prices were deeply below a reasonable level (especially in low-tier submarkets that were locked out of the mortgage market by federal regulators).” What Erdmann acknowledges here is that those who would typically purchase homes on the lowest price tier were suddenly limited in their access to credit, which was a result of the banking reforms in the Dodd-Frank Act. As documented in the catalog of research on this topic, this particular void was effectively filled by institutional investors. Even high-income earners with average to bad credit histories were statutorily prevented from qualifying for home mortgages.
He also points out that homeownership rates in metro Atlanta have been increasing at a steady rate of about 0.3 percent annually since the after-effects of the mortgage shock ended (the outlier seen in the 2020 homeownership rate is attributed to the Census Bureau halting data collection during the COVID-19 pandemic).
Erdmann continues by explaining that the number of “naturally forming households”–such as a child moving out of their parents’ house or a couple getting married and moving in together–“is closer to the 62 percent bottom, and the current homeownership rate in Georgia is inflated because renter households aren’t forming. It’s the lack of renter households that is lifting the homeownership rate.” He goes on to mention two specific examples for how current societal tendencies are reflected in these data: adult children continuing to live with their parents and homeowners being forced to take on roommates for financial reasons. The larger trend of potential homebuyers being locked out of the mortgage market is examined in further detail later in the study.
Lastly, Erdmann uses the chart to indicate the lack of correlation between home prices and the presence of institutional investors (reflected in the homeownership rate) in the Atlanta market. “Home prices were no higher when homeownership bottomed than they had been before it started to decline.”  The lowest concentration of homeownership in the 25 years of data collected occurred from 2014-2017. This period, with the highest concentration of single-family homes in the hands of investors and renters, resulted in home prices that were roughly the same among high-tier homes, and were lower among low-tier homes, than before the Great Recession.
We can also examine homeownership rates at the county level to further explore whether there has been an increase in the presence of investor-owned homes. This chart, compiled by the Georgia Public Policy Foundation using data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’ FRED database, shows homeownership rates in 12 metro Atlanta counties from 2009-2023. Homeownership rates were calculated by dividing the estimated total population in owner-occupied units by the estimated total population. Specifically, rates of homeownership over this period were the lowest in Clayton, Fulton and DeKalb Counties, while the highest homeownership rates were in Forsyth, Fayette, Cherokee and Paulding Counties.
Here, we can compare the level of investor presence in each metro Atlanta county to the percentages of owner-occupied housing. The seven companies referenced in the chart that make up “Corporate-Owned SFH” were identified as “nationwide corporate landlords” in research from Parcl Labs that “uses an advanced algorithm to identify and track ‘true owners’ in the housing market (such as corporate LLCs).” Owner-occupancy in this chart is determined by dividing the number of single-family, owner-occupied housing units by the total stock of single-family housing. The counties are ordered from highest level of investor presence (8.27 percent in Henry County) to lowest (0.53 percent in Spalding County). Here, we see that even in Henry County, the share of single-family homes owned by corporate investors is lower than the share of those owned by other investors. Also of note, the owner-occupancy rate in Henry (per the earlier chart) rose steadily since 2019.
Institutional investors in context of the housing market
Housing problems throughout the nation far predate the rise of institutional investors. Georgia has reaped the benefits of adding a million new residents each decade since 1980, but housing production has not kept pace with demand. As the Foundation noted in its previous housing report, this problem was greatly exacerbated by the Great Recession, as the 2010s saw half as many homes built as in the previous decade. This “lost decade” coincided with the rise of institutional investors. Given their concentration of significant capital in the market, they have become an easy target for rising populist sentiment, earning labels like “Wall Street,” “big banks” and “large, out-of-state corporations.”
This targeting has been reinforced by frequently cited local research, such as a study from Georgia State University which asserts that three companies own roughly 19,000 single-family rental homes in the Atlanta area. This accounts for roughly 11 percent of the region’s single-family rental market. This figure is often cited as evidence that investors are shutting out potential home buyers.
However, as Erdmann points out, metro Atlanta has nearly 3 million total homes, meaning these 19,000 homes represent only 0.6 percent of the total housing market. In that context, the companies’ share is far too small to explain metro Atlanta’s broader housing affordability challenges.
The dropoff in housing production in the face of sustained population growth presents the clearest answer in an increasingly complex housing market. As Erdmann summarizes, “In the decade leading up to 2008, Georgia reliably permitted new homes equal to about 2.5 percent of the existing stock of homes. It hasn’t topped 1.5 percent since 2007. Georgia permitted 0.5 percent of its existing stock of homes in 2012, when institutional buyers were starting to enter the market. It’s taken more than a decade for large institutions to buy up a couple percentage points of Georgia homes. If this was a problem–if this really was ‘shutting homebuyers out’ of the Georgia housing market–exactly how was this not a solvable problem? Georgia couldn’t have permitted an additional, say, 0.2 percent of new homes for homeowners each year to make up for it?”
Public policy proposals to limit investor activity could result in some short-term impacts, such as easing competition for starter homes and expanding opportunities for individual buyers, but it could also risk unintended consequences like reducing the rental supply. Regardless, such action would address a symptom rather than a cause of enduring housing trends. Evidence suggests that much of the link between investors and rising prices reflects investors’ targeting of markets with population growth but not growth of housing stock, rather than directly causing price increases. In other words, the same policy problems that attracted investors to metro Atlanta in the first place are preventing the supply side of the market from correcting any price pressure they might be creating.
It is therefore possible that limiting their market presence might do little to lower prices while further shrinking the supply of housing options. Impact overall would depend on whether such policies are joined by broader supply-side reforms in zoning, construction and affordability, which remain far more fundamental constraints on access and costs.
In a recent op-ed, Reason Foundation vice president Adrian Moore and Reason policy analyst Eliza Terziev argued that public policy targeting of institutional investors stems from a misunderstanding of both how they operate and the real scale of their presence in the housing market. They note, “the market is not acting as the critics of institutional investors say. If investors are driving up prices, the natural market response would be to increase supply … but while prices did increase, housing supply hasn’t kept up. Persistent regulatory barriers, including zoning restrictions, minimum lot sizes, limits on multifamily housing, and long and costly permitting processes have made it difficult, if not impossible, to meet the rise in demand in a cost-effective way.”
Mortgage regulations and the ability to purchase a home
As noted earlier, people choose to rent for various reasons. What is less discussed is the number of potential home buyers who are forced to rent. Because most credit agencies and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CPFB) define credit scores and their associated numeric ranges differently, a number is provided when discussed below to help define the criteria.
The data reflect an increasing shortage of mortgages available for those who do not have “superprime” credit scores of 760+ points. Primarily this is because these potential buyers are no longer eligible to qualify for a mortgage due to lending regulations enacted after the Great Recession. Notably, this includes potential buyers with “good” and “very good” credit scores, and not just the subprime mortgage market, 0 percent adjustable rate mortgages and the NINJA (no income, no job, no assets) loans typified with the housing market bubble of the Great Recession.
The prevalence of these subprime home mortgages and the resulting widespread loan defaults led policymakers to create tougher lending requirements for home mortgages through the Dodd-Frank Act. As the CPFB wrote in its summary of the qualified mortgage standards that were enacted, “During the years preceding the mortgage crisis, too many mortgages were made to consumers without regard to the consumer’s ability to repay the loans. Loose underwriting practices by some creditors—including failure to verify the consumer’s income or debts and qualifying consumers for mortgages based on “teaser” interest rates that would cause monthly payments to jump to unaffordable levels after the first few years—contributed to a mortgage crisis that led to the nation’s most serious recession since the Great Depression.”
To safeguard against “loose underwriting practices,” eight minimum criteria were implemented for creditors. These included items such as expected income or assets, employment status, monthly mortgage payment debt obligations and credit history. The practical effect has been to increasingly keep those without “superprime” mortgage scores from qualifying to purchase a home, as the chart below demonstrates.
In this dataset, collected by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, we see that in 2005 home mortgage recipients with “superprime” credit scores, defined here as 760 or higher, constituted roughly 25 percent of home mortgages. Twenty years later, borrowers in this same credit tier comprise almost 65 percent of home mortgages originated. While policymakers may debate the correct credit score for being eligible to receive a home mortgage, it appears likely that as long as the current lending regulations remain in place, investor-owned housing will remain the primary bridge option for those unable to purchase a home.
Conclusion
Housing shortages in Georgia and throughout the country affect several aspects of public policy and daily life. The goal of building equity through home ownership is shared by millions of citizens and is an indispensable part of the American dream. Building a durable supply of affordable housing is an effort that needs attention from stakeholders across the spectrum of politics and government.
The recent tendency among policymakers and policy advocates to focus on institutional investors is understandable. Their prevalence in the housing market after the Great Recession was correlated with the drop-offs in housing production and worsening housing shortages. Their presence is, at least in certain areas, associated with higher housing costs, and areas that contain high concentrations of investor-owned properties can experience constraint in the for-sale market. Their concentration of considerable capital and status as large, out-of-state financial entities makes them an easy target for criticism.
However, serious attempts to address housing unaffordability must look to more direct and fundamental causes. Furthermore, the expenditure of finite political capital in the hopes of addressing housing at large would potentially be wasted on a push to limit institutional investors. As with any policy area, the appetite for housing reform is limited and lawmakers might be less likely to focus on other more impactful solutions.
The limits of making investors central to housing policy also partly stem from a body of research that has yielded limited, mixed and inconclusive results. One of the reasons for inconsistent results is the lack of a consensus definition of institutional investors. In its report, the GAO noted that the way investors were defined was not constant across the studies it referenced, and that investor effects on factors like homeownership opportunities and tenants was unclear due to limited data and the lack of a consistent definition.
It is common to designate investors by the number of properties or units owned, but it is worth considering that this quantitative definition is too blunt to accurately describe an institutional investor. A better definition might combine a quantitative threshold with other characteristics like financialization and a portfolio-driven market strategy in order to designate owners by how they operate, not just how much they own.
Ultimately, any attempt to legislate or otherwise regulate investor activity must account for the context of how investors operate in the market. While it is true that metro Atlanta’s share of institutional investor-owned properties is the highest in the country, which could lead to more pronounced effects than would be seen elsewhere, investors still typically occupy much smaller shares of housing than other kinds of ownership. Investors might benefit from, and in some cases contribute to, existing housing trends, but they neither cause nor primarily drive them.
A more direct approach to housing policy should focus on fundamental supply-side factors that add to the cost of regulation. Hurdles like zoning ordinances, building regulations, the cost of construction materials and manpower, permitting processes and mortgage rates add to the cost of housing everywhere, and policymakers should take care not to miss the forest for the trees when trying to create a cheaper, more accessible and more diverse housing market.",https://www.housingwire.com/articles/trump-proposes-50-year-mortgage-to-help-affordability/,America,39.828175,-98.5795,2,housingwire.com

 Boston city councilors propose measures to tackle housing affordability crisis ahead of local elections 
 
 By Grace Whinnery • November 3, 2025    

Boston City Council members have proposed numerous ways to address the housing affordability crisis, which has been identified as a key issue for voters in the upcoming municipal election.

The average rent in Boston for a one-bedroom apartment is $3,452 a month, compared to the national average of $1,631 a month, according to Apartments.com The price of an average single-family home in Massachusetts increased 74% from 2016 to 2024, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. 
“The cost of housing is rising in our neighborhoods,” said City Councilor Sharon Durkan, who represents district 8, which includes Boston University. “It’s something that I hear from residents every day at my office hours, residents are being priced out.” 
12% of Boston voters believe housing affordability is the most important issue facing the United States, according to Emerson College polling. 
Durkan said the council has been taking “bold steps” to allow for the development of more housing.  
Some of the steps Durkan emphasized included amending the zoning code to make housing an allowed use in the Bullfinch Triangle, an area in Boston nestled between the West and North Ends, as well as the PLAN: Downtown initiative to bring more affordable housing to the Downtown area. 
Durkan’s platform supports planning for “abundance” in Boston housing. 
“[Abundance is] about saying yes to new people moving into the city,” Durkan said. “It’s about saying yes to new neighbors, and yes to making sure that our communities and the people that want to live there can stay there.”  
City Councilor Ed Flynn said the city needs to increase the supply of affordable housing units to help address the housing crisis. 
“I’ve been a strong advocate for increasing affordable housing, veteran’s housing [and] family-size units to help working families remain in the city,” Flynn said. 
Other initiatives to allow for more housing include At-Large City Councilor Henry Santana’s proposed expansion of triple decker housing. Current zoning laws limit many buildings to two and a half stories, preventing the construction of triple-deckers. 
As another strategy to address the housing affordability crisis, Santana, along with City Councilors Benjamin Weber and Enrique Pepén, none of whom decided to comment, sponsored a resolution in support of a rent control measure on the 2026 ballot. The initiative, filed by Homes For All Massachusetts, would reverse the statewide ban on rent control passed in 1994. 
Tamara Small, CEO of NAIOP Massachusetts, an association representing the interests of the real estate industry, said rent control measures would be detrimental to the development of more housing statewide. 
“We are already getting calls from investors all over the world who have heard about this proposal, and they have said if rent control is adopted, then it’s really going to kill housing production in Massachusetts,” Small said.  
City Councilor Brian Worrell, in a city council meeting Oct. 29, proposed a plan to increase taxes on large and luxury apartment buildings and decrease tax bills for small landlords and average homeowners. 
“Homeowners and small landlords are carrying a heavier load while larger apartment owners often pay less taxes per unit,” Worrell said in the hearing. 
Durkan said she opposes Worrell’s proposal, calling it a “gut-punch at the wrong moment” for housing development. 
“[The proposal] really places undue burden on dense areas,” Durkan said, “If we’re trying to encourage housing production and density in the city of Boston … it really doesn’t fit with the city’s goals at the moment.” 
Small also disagreed with Worell’s proposal, and said expenses would get pushed on tenants and would “dramatically disincentivize any type of investment in Boston housing development.” 
Hilary Pizer, director of Organizing and Policy at the Massachusetts Affordable Homeownership Alliance, wrote in support of Worrell’s policy in a statement to the Daily Free Press.  
“MAHA strongly supports this proposal that offers property tax relief to homeowners being squeezed by rising costs,” Pizer wrote. “When you own the home you live in, it’s your shelter, and eventually your nest egg. It should be taxed at the lower residential rate.”

Penn Architecture hosts panel on adaptive building reuse in cities
The panel discussion took place in Meyerson Hall on Oct. 29. GRACE CHEN / THE DAILY PENNSYLVANIAN
By COSTA GAY-AFENDULIS
Nov. 3, 2025

Penn’s Architecture department hosted a panel at the Weitzman School of Design to discuss the practice of adaptively converting vacant office buildings into residential units in cities.

The Oct. 29 panel included six experts in the field with backgrounds in architecture, journalism, and finance who spoke about the benefits and considerations of applying adaptive reuse on a large scale. This practice has gained traction in recent years as a way to bring life back to central business districts following a shift to remote work that has emptied out many American downtowns and the rapidly growing demand for housing. 

Weitzman associate professor of practice Hina Jamelle, who also serves as the school’s urban housing director, organized the event. During the panel, she explained that there has been “a renewed attention on adaptive reuse, especially the conversion of commercial buildings into housing.”

Jamelle added that the event’s title, “Under Pressure”, refers to “a call for action in a timely and efficient way, because [they] realize that pressure has come to bear on certain aspects of the city.” She emphasized that the housing crisis is relevant to Penn students because “the chances are very high” that many of them are “going to be moving to an urban center” upon graduation.

“Everyone needs a place to live,” she said. “We would not want cities to just be for sort of a certain asset class. You really want a city to have that engaging vibrancy of younger people coming in, new ideas coming in, and people being able to thrive.” 

Weitzman city and regional planning professor Vincent Reina, who worked as an urban housing policy advisor in the Biden-Harris administration, sat on the panel. He emphasized a need for “actual affordable units,” given that there is an estimated “shortage of 65,000 affordable, available housing units” in the city. 

“If you look at the housing stock in Philadelphia, we actually have enough housing for most households,” he said during the event. “We just don’t have enough housing for the very poor households.”

In an interview with The Daily Pennsylvanian, Reina said that solving these issues in the city “requires a real and consistent commitment from the city to address the housing needs, but particularly for the most vulnerable residents”. 

Reina has prior experience working with students on public housing projects in New York City, which he said “spurred” him to think about “the critical role that housing plays” in helping residents feel that they are “a part of the community.”

Reina told the DP that his team helped develop PHL Housing Plus, a project to rehabilitate homes for affordability, and other Philadelphia initiatives such as Rebuilding Together. 

Architecture student Ryan Newbling emphasized the importance of having urban “space that really connects and drives a community, versus just having repetitive residential units,” in an interview with the DP.

Newbling added that the event was also integrated into the graduate architecture program. Students had their own work “on display,” which focused on “bringing life back to urban spaces.”

Wall Street Journal reporter and panelist Peter Grant emphasized the historical significance of the broad evacuation of office space and why reuse is worth the investment. According to Grant, unlike downturns in office use in the late 1990s and late 2010s that ended up rebounding, “the downturn now is not cyclical, it’s structural … this is here to stay.”

However, the panelists also discussed the complications and costs of the process of adaptive reuse. Buildings that are constructed to serve as office spaces often face fewer structural requirements than residential units — such as for included window spaces — and need expensive renovations. Grant discussed how economic factors still aren’t fully allowing this process to be implemented on a large scale everywhere. 

“There’s one city where you do have the necessary ingredients, and that’s New York,” Grant said during the event. “You have some Magic Mountain out there in New York that’s producing people who are making enough money to afford $4,000 a month rents — that’s not happening in a lot of these other markets.”

The panelists provided examples of proposed and completed reuse projects in a wide range of cities, like Chicago, New York, Baton Rouge, La., and Providence, R.I.

Reina concluded that adaptive reuse is “a really important piece” of solving the housing crisis. 

“Can you actually solve our housing supply problems with these conversions? I think no,” Reina said. “But you add a really important piece to our puzzle — to our many tools that we need to actually address our housing supply needs and community issues.”

This week, the Local Government Commission, chaired by Republican state Treasurer Brad Briner, approved over $370 million in bonds around the state for affordable housing and retirement homes.
In a press release, Briner said, “Affordable housing remains a challenge in North Carolina, and the Local Government Commission (LGC) continues to fulfill its role in attacking the problem,” while also noting that the LGC “has a statutory duty to approve most debt issued by units of local government and public authorities in the state,” as long as they can show the debt amount is appropriate and the local government unit “can reasonably afford to repay the debt.”
Thankfully, these bonds were mostly “conduit revenue bonds,” where the financial risks are borne by the private builder and their bondholders, not the government. The builder simply gets access to a lower cost loan through the local government in exchange for being allowed to carry out a project that local planners want to see. But even if this won’t bankrupt a town or county, it still reveals a misguided approach to “affordable housing.”

If they really want to make housing affordable in their areas, giving up this desire to micro-manage the “planning process,” not pressing it further, is what will actually begin to attack the problem.
Mixed progress
To start with the positive, there really are some good trends. A lot of North Carolina’s more populous areas have loosened the restrictions on “single-family” zoned areas. Rather than just one house per lot, city and county governments have been moving towards allowing things like accessory dwelling units (called ADUs or granny flats) and multi-family “missing middle” housing like duplexes, town homes, and quads.
But even if they allow more variety and density in formerly single-family zoned areas, some government planners are not nearly as flexible if you want to build outside of designated urban areas.
For a drastic comparison on this front, we can look at two Triangle-area counties, Orange and Wake. Wake has largely allowed building, and now has multiple new major municipalities that were small towns at best just one generation ago (Morrisville, Cary, Rolesville, Knightdale, Apex etc).
Orange County, on the other hand, has such strict local zoning rules that most of the county is locked in time. Chapel Hill had 26,199 people in 1970, while Cary had only 7,686. But the estimated populations for 2025 are 62,043 for Chapel Hill and 181,838 for Cary. So Chapel Hill, which had been the much bigger and more well-known city, basically doubled, while Cary grew 24-times larger — now bigger than, not just Chapel Hill, but all of Orange County.
And outside city limits, Orange County has grown even less. This is largely due to the county’s obsession with strict planning, as seen in their current “Comprehensive Land Use Plan.”
The plan says that “per North Carolina General Statute § 153A-121,” they are authorized to “define, regulate, prohibit, or abate acts, omissions, or conditions detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare of its citizens.”
And they take this authority in a very broad sense, saying that “this Comprehensive Plan will strive, in its implementation, to link the economy, the environment and social equity to improve the vitality of all three of these domains.”
So, in short, they believe they can determine how all land in the county should be used and why (to achieve certain progressive social and environmental goals). To display just how extreme this is in practice, see the map below of the areas where development is allowed and where it is severely limited. That bottom southeast corner is where Chapel Hill/Carrboro is, and the area along I-85 is where Mebane, Hillsborough, and a small portion of Durham are. The planners have decided that everything else should be left (permanently?) rural.
Most of this land is designated low-density “rural residential,” while the area between the two largest population centers of Chapel Hill/Carrboro and Hillsborough (inside the yellow lines) is an even stricter “rural buffer,” despite that being the most obvious place to develop in a growing county. So, basically, if you want to build much of anything in the county, unless it’s in one of the approved human-activity zones, you’re probably out of luck.
Even if you are a community of progressive artists and musicians who want to use a 90-acre property to create a environmentally conscious communal-living development for those 55+, where 60 of those acres are permanently set aside for natural conservation, you can’t — because that would “threaten the character of rural Orange County.” Fiddlehead Corner, the project in question, purchased their land and sought to build everything in as eco-friendly way as possible, but, in March of this year, they were still denied.
“The Orange County Board of County Commissioners unanimously denied the rezoning requested for H4D that would have allowed us to proceed with our plan to build Fiddlehead Corner as a clustered community on the Morrow Mill property,” said an update on the community’s website. “Several commissioners commented that the master plan was good, even wonderful. But their statements expressed concern that our proposed way of implementing the plan – expanding a rural activity node and siting a community there – sets a precedent that could lead to widespread imitation, which they fear would threaten the character of rural Orange County.”
In a recent opinion piece in the Daily Tar Heel defending the “rural buffer” amid Orange County’s plan-updating process, the author defended it by noting that when the popular ice cream spot Maple View Farms “was bought out in 2021 by a cast of crooks”who “attempted to bastardize the sacred soil of Maple View Farms” with “a hotel and amphitheater with a capacity rivaling the scale of the Durham Performing Arts Center. The one thing that stopped this project from continuing? The Rural Buffer.”
So this “buffer” not only prevents much-needed housing from being built, it also prevents a beloved landmark between Hillsborough and Chapel Hill from expanding and adding more attractions? Victory, I guess (mostly for those who already have the housing they need and don’t like fun).
Because of the difficulty and humiliation in having to deal with “the planners,” many make decisions that allow them to avoid them altogether. A couple years ago, I noticed that a whole stretch of lots in rural Orange County were exactly 10.01 acres and asked a real estate agent friend about why that would be. She explained to me that there is a state law that exempts landowners from most local subdivision and planning requirements if they split the land into lots greater than 10 acres.
In growing urban regions like the Triangle, even if some think farms are beautiful to drive by, agriculture is no longer the “highest and best use” of the land. If a farmer sees that his land value has skyrocketed and wants to sell to a developer to build housing, which has become the highest-and-best use, he can’t, unless he goes to a planning department (who will tell him no, since it would violate rural character).
So instead, he chops his 80-acre farm into eight 10-acre “estate” lots. Does it really “preserve rural character” and save farm land to have these eight lots, owned by people with no interest in farming and who now have to mow massive lawns? Might it not be better for these aims to allow the farmer to sell off 10 one-acre lots and potentially keep the other 70 acres as a farm?
(And a broader question: Would moving that statewide exemption from 10 acres to one acre add a lot more buildable land, thereby reducing building costs and increasing housing stock without major negative tradeoffs? Somebody else can answer that one.)
While my county is fairly extreme on this front, the same principle applies across the state. Officials look out across their jurisdiction like Mufasa from Pride Rock and begin the intoxicating process of planning what should be done with others’ land. “This part of town really should have more woods.” “The lots are too small (or big) on that street.” “A grocery store over there would be kind of an eyesore.” “I like all the farmland I see on my commute. It should stay that way.” And on and on.
But they don’t always consider whether this should be their call to make — whether the Fiddlehead Corner community should have to align with their vision for the county, whether a farmer who wants to buy a bigger farm in a cheaper part of the state should be prevented from selling his land to a housing developer. Yet, somehow these same commissioners frequently bemoan the lack of affordable housing. But a few government planned “affordable housing” projects cannot make up for all of the projects that have been blocked. There’s a much easier and cheaper way to make housing affordable: stop trying to control the process and let the market create the housing it needs.

Housing leaders discuss affordability, migration, and energy costs shaping Valley market

It’s no secret that one of the largest issues facing the Central Valley and the rest of the nation throughout 2025 has been housing affordability, as demand continues to outpace supply.
The Center for California Real Estate (CCRE) hosted a panel on Oct. 16 in partnership with the Fresno State Gazarian Real Estate Center, discussing the Central Valley’s housing challenges and the important role that Realtors play in shaping policy and market dynamics.
Tamara Suminski, president of the California Association of Realtors, opened the discussion by highlighting California’s market trends.
“Data from CAR’s monthly home sales and price reports shows that statewide home sales edged up nearly 1% in August from July, as mortgage rates fell to their lowest level in a year, while the median home price held steady at just under $900,000,” Suminski said.
However, sales declined by 3.5% year-over-year in the Central Valley, although strong pending actively shows potential for more stabilization.
Fresno Mayor Jerry Dyer discussed the demand led affordability crisis.
“The demand has far exceeded the supply here in Fresno,” Dyer said, noting more and more residents from coastal areas like the Bay Area and Los Angeles moving to Fresno, particularly post-pandemic.
Joanna Odabashian, the CEO of Keller-Williams, attended the event and shared her thoughts on more people moving to Fresno and the Central Valley from out of the area.
“Their money goes farther here, and they make more [at their jobs in larger cities]. And so they think, ‘Oh, we can come here and get a very nice home for a lot less, and many of them are allowed to still do remote work,” she told The Business Journal.
Dyer also noted that Fresno’s proximity, lifestyle and affordability have fueled migration, but high energy costs don’t help some of the issues.
“Energy rates here in Fresno, in the Valley, are 80% higher than anywhere else in the nation,” he said, adding that PG&E rates have risen over 50% in recent years.
Earlier this year, at the Fresno County Economic Development Corp. real estate forecast, Dyer had a discussion with PG&E CEO Patti Poppe regarding infrastructure improvements, partnerships and ongoing efforts to rebuild trust with Fresno residents and officials.
“One of the biggest drivers of our bills going up was the need to harden our system to wildfire and other extreme weather, not just wildfire, but extreme rains, extreme winds, extreme snow up in the Sierras,” Poppe said in an interview with The Business Journal following the event. “We are building infrastructure, transforming our infrastructure so it’s fit for purpose. It’s an important investment to make, but that investment will have returns over decades to come while we continue to reduce the cost to maintain that equipment every single year.”
Dyer touched on Fresno’s increased efforts to address the housing crisis through the One Fresno Housing Strategy, which includes 47 action-oriented initiatives
“We’re almost done with all 47 strategies,” he said, noting a 144% increase in affordable housing units planned for 2026 compared to prior years.
However, he stressed the need for balance, noting the need for market-rate housing in addition to affordable housing.
“Affordable housing doesn’t pay the bills. We don’t get property tax from it. We have to have market-rate housing,” Dyer said, advocating for policies that support homeownership as “the best form of rent stabilization.”
Carol Ornelas, president and CEO of Visionary Home Builders of California, noted the rising costs of construction and insurance as major hurdles.
“One of the biggest things today that’s affecting [housing] is, how much does insurance cost?” Ornelas said, noting that course-of-construction insurance has surged from $300,000 to $1 million for a two-year period due to fire risks and other factors.
She also highlighted labor shortages and tariffs as challenges, stating the need for community engagement, while giving a call to action to Realtors and community members.
“We need everybody in this room to get on a table when it’s talking about your community and your needs, because the Central Valley’s been pretty well neglected for a very long time,” she said.
Bernadette Austin, CEO of Civic Well, a Sacramento-based nonprofit that works with community leaders on sustainability, pointed to the economic and demographic shifts driving housing pressures.
A research project she led found that post-pandemic migration to the Central Valley was driven not only by affordability but also by housing stock availability.
“People were moving… because they needed more affordable housing… [but also for] the availability of housing stock. How big were the homes? Were their kids able to have their own bedrooms?” Austin said.

2025-11-06 06:45:00,"Investors purchasing entry-level homes in some markets may be hindering affordability for first-time and entry-level homebuyers, according to a report from Realtor.com released Thursday.
To craft its Mid-year Investor Report, Realtor.com examined deed records from January 2000 to July 2025 on a national, state and large metro-level. The report only included single-family homes, condos, townhomes and row houses.
According to the report, 10.8% of all homes purchased in Q2 2025 were bought by real estate investors, up 0.1 percentage point compared to a year prior. However, this is still below the peak of 12.1% reported in Q2 2022. In total, during the first half of 2025, investors purchased roughly 257,000 homes, down 1.8% year-over-year. Overall home sales fell by 3.8% during the same time period.
Real estate investors are buying more than selling
On the sell side, investors sold 9.2% of all homes sold in Q2 2025, the same as a year ago.
In total, investors purchased roughly 41, 000 more homes than they sold during the first half of 2025. This gap is 10.8% wider than the first half of 2024, which the report attributes to easing investor selling activity. Overall, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, investors have purchase roughly 726,000 more homes than they have sold, which the report claims has put pressure on the homeownership rate.
Missouri, Mississippi lead investor activity
The state with the highest share of investor buyers was Missouri at 18.9%, followed by Mississippi (17.1%), and Nevada (15.4%). On a metro level-basis, of the 50 largest metros Memphis, TN-MS-AR had the largest share or investor activity at 25.2%, up 4.7% annually. St. Louis, MO-KS came second with 20.6% followed by Kansas City, MO-KS at 19.3%. Of the top-10 metros, Columbus, Ohio saw the largest annual increase in investor purchaser activity at 6.0%.
In Michigan (-53.1%), Maryland (-45.4%), and Virginia (-45.0%) investors tend to purchase properties below the median market purchase price, while in Montana (+35.1%), Utah (+33.7%), and California (+23.3%), investors paid the largest premiums.
On the metro level, the typical investor purchase price was much lower than the market median in Detroit (-58.0%), Pittsburgh (-52.7%), and Baltimore (-52.0%). In contrast, investors paid the highest home premiums in Los Angeles (+19.8%), San Diego (+9.2%), and New York City (+8.7%).
According to the report, in the states and metros where investors are purchasing homes far below the median price point, they are competing with entry-level homebuyers, which could potentially increase affordability stress on these types of homebuyers
Overall, during the second quarter of 2025, the typical investor purchased a home for $287,000, more than $80,000 below the national median sale price.
When it comes to investor size, the share of small real estate investors purchasing homes reached its highest level since 2007 during the first half of 2025, with small investors accounting for 62.5% of all investor purchases. Meanwhile, medium investors accounted for 17.6% of all purchases and large investors accounted for 19.8% of purchases. According to the report, this drop off in the share of large investor purchases began in 2022.
Looking ahead, due to greater economic uncertainty, Realtor.com believes that investors are likely to focus on markets that offer a combination of affordability and steady housing demand.

Newswise — INDIANAPOLIS— To provide the public with a clearer understanding of today’s real estate market and bridge the gap between academic research and industry practice, the Indiana University Kelley School of Business Center for Real Estate Studies and Indiana Business Research Center have released the Fall 2025 Kelley Real Estate Outlook.

 This issue features expert analysis from Kelley professor Jun Zhu, who examines the rise in serious delinquencies on Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans, which are designed to make home ownership more accessible through lower down payments. Published biannually, the Kelley Real Estate Outlook also includes research summaries from multiple institutions and is curated by Sara Heidtmann Coers, associate director of the Center for Real Estate Studies and lecturer in real estate at Kelley Indianapolis.

Additionally, the report features an article by Chris Hancock, CEO of the Builders Association of Greater Indianapolis (BAGI), who addresses the challenges builders face in today’s market and the growing concerns around housing affordability.

“Our world is increasingly data-driven, and while technology has transformed real estate development, most people still lack access to free, reliable data,” said Coers. “We aim to provide meaningful, data-driven insights that go beyond surface-level trends. We also want to make academic research accessible and actionable for industry professionals.”

Coers highlighted the Power Grid, a tool included in the Outlook and updated regularly, as a free and valuable resource for market metrics. “This consolidates key data into one place, eliminating the need for multiple searches or costly subscriptions,” Coers shared. “Our goal is to maximize value for readers by presenting information in clear, industry-focused language.”

A deeper dive into FHA loan delinquencies

Zhu, a clinical associate professor of finance at the Kelley School, partnered with her colleagues at the Urban Institute for this research. It examined why the number of FHA delinquencies has increased in a short period of time.

“From mid-2024 to February 2025, FHA mortgage delinquencies jumped from 3.7% to 4.8%. FHA loans are insured loans intended to make home ownership more accessible with low down payments,” Zhu wrote.

FHA loans are a common tool for first-time home buyers requiring a 3.5% down payment and are considered delinquent when 90 days past due. FHA loan delinquency is typically the first place experts see broader economic issues rising, according to Coers.

“When we first approached this issue, the most likely culprit seemed obvious as one or more of the items on the list of usual suspects: relaxed lending standards (including higher debt-to-income [DTI] ratios and competition from government-sponsored enterprises [GSEs]), slowing home price appreciation, or improved loss mitigation encouraging strategic defaults. But according to our study, none of these explanations hold water. In fact, the answer turned out to be much simpler than expected,” Zhu said.

Researchers concluded that borrowers are simply experiencing greater financial stress.

“Inflation has consistently outpaced wage growth, eroding families’ ability to build the emergency savings needed to weather unexpected financial shocks. This financial pressure extends far beyond mortgages — delinquency rates have climbed simultaneously across auto loans, credit cards, and buy-now-pay-later products, suggesting a broad-based affordability crisis rather than housing-specific issues,” Zhu wrote. “Additional stressors compound the problem: an unprecedented frequency of natural disasters, insurance premiums that have skyrocketed in many markets, and property tax increases that particularly burden newer homeowners who haven’t had time to build equity cushions.”

Despite these challenges, Zhu emphasized that today’s environment differs from the 2008 housing crisis. Enhanced foreclosure-prevention tools and a strong FHA insurance fund provide critical safeguards against systemic risk.

Builders Association of Greater Indianapolis Weighs In

Chris Hancock’s contribution to the outlook examines the state of new home construction. While national trends show slowing growth, Central Indiana’s data proposes a different outlook.

.“In Central Indiana (the nine-county Indianapolis region), the new home construction market remains resilient. BAGI data shows a 6% year-over-year rise in single-family building permits for June 2025. Through mid-2025, total permits filed in the region were up 6% from the first half of 2024. This performance stands in sharp contrast to national trends, where new home activity has seen slower growth,” Hancock wrote.

However, key challenges nationwide continue to be factors: supply chain delays, land development costs, and labor shortages.

“While home prices have stabilized in 2025, affordability remains the most pressing concern for both buyers and builders. The trifecta of rising labor costs, elevated material prices, and tighter lending conditions directly impacts what gets built,” he added.

Hancock concluded that the future depends on collaboration among builders, policymakers, and community leaders. “If stakeholders work together to address these challenges, Central Indiana can maintain its position as a dynamic and accessible housing market.”

The Fall 2025 Kelley Real Estate Outlook provides an industry roadmap for understanding the forces shaping Indiana’s housing market and beyond. By combining academic research with practical industry insights, the outlook aims to inform professionals across the real estate industry.

The choice on housing is between affordability and control

LISTEN TO THIS STORY (10 minutes)

This week, the Local Government Commission, chaired by Republican state Treasurer Brad Briner, approved over $370 million in bonds around the state for affordable housing and retirement homes.

In a press release, Briner said, “Affordable housing remains a challenge in North Carolina, and the Local Government Commission (LGC) continues to fulfill its role in attacking the problem,” while also noting that the LGC “has a statutory duty to approve most debt issued by units of local government and public authorities in the state,” as long as they can show the debt amount is appropriate and the local government unit “can reasonably afford to repay the debt.”

Thankfully, these bonds were mostly “conduit revenue bonds,” where the financial risks are borne by the private builder and their bondholders, not the government. The builder simply gets access to a lower cost loan through the local government in exchange for being allowed to carry out a project that local planners want to see. But even if this won’t bankrupt a town or county, it still reveals a misguided approach to “affordable housing.”

If they really want to make housing affordable in their areas, giving up this desire to micro-manage the “planning process,” not pressing it further, is what will actually begin to attack the problem.

MIXED PROGRESS

To start with the positive, there really are some good trends. A lot of North Carolina’s more populous areas have loosened the restrictions on “single-family” zoned areas. Rather than just one dwelling per lot, city and county governments have been moving towards allowing things like accessory dwelling units (called ADUs or granny flats) and multi-family “missing middle” housing like duplexes, town homes, and quads.

But even if they allow more variety and density in formerly single-family zoned areas, some government planners are not nearly as flexible if you want to build outside of designated urban areas.

For a drastic comparison on this front, we can look at two Triangle-area counties, Orange and Wake. Wake has largely allowed building, and now has multiple new major municipalities that were small towns at best just one generation ago (Morrisville, Cary, Rolesville, Knightdale, Apex etc).

Orange County, on the other hand, has such strict local zoning rules that most of the county is locked in time. Chapel Hill had 26,199 people in 1970, while Cary had only 7,686. But the estimated populations for 2025 are 62,043 for Chapel Hill and 181,838 for Cary. So Chapel Hill, which had been the much bigger and more well-known city, basically doubled, while Cary grew 24-times larger — now bigger than, not just Chapel Hill, but all of Orange County.

And outside city limits, Orange County has grown even less. This is largely due to the county’s obsession with strict planning, as seen in their current “Comprehensive Land Use Plan.”

The plan says that “per North Carolina General Statute § 153A-121,” they are authorized to “define, regulate, prohibit, or abate acts, omissions, or conditions detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare of its citizens.”

And they take this authority in a very broad sense, saying that “this Comprehensive Plan will strive, in its implementation, to link the economy, the environment and social equity to improve the vitality of all three of these domains.”

So, in short, they believe they can determine how all land in the county should be used and why (to achieve certain progressive social and environmental goals). To display just how extreme this is in practice, see the map below of the areas where development is allowed and where it is severely limited. That bottom southeast corner is where Chapel Hill/Carrboro is, and the area along I-85 is where Mebane, Hillsborough, and a small portion of Durham are. The planners have decided that everything else should be left (permanently?) rural.

Most of this land is designated low-density “rural residential,” while the area between the two largest population centers of Chapel Hill/Carrboro and Hillsborough (inside the yellow lines) is an even stricter “rural buffer,” despite that being the most obvious place to develop in a growing county. So, basically, if you want to build much of anything in the county, unless it’s in one of the approved human-activity zones, you’re probably out of luck.

Even if you are a community of progressive artists and musicians who want to use a 90-acre property to create an environmentally conscious communal-living development for those 55+, where 60 of those acres are permanently set aside for natural conservation, you can’t — because that would “threaten the character of rural Orange County.” Fiddlehead Corner, the project in question, purchased their land and sought to build everything in as eco-friendly way as possible, but, in March of this year, they were still denied.

“The Orange County Board of County Commissioners unanimously denied the rezoning requested for H4D that would have allowed us to proceed with our plan to build Fiddlehead Corner as a clustered community on the Morrow Mill property,” said an update on the community’s website. “Several commissioners commented that the master plan was good, even wonderful. But their statements expressed concern that our proposed way of implementing the plan – expanding a rural activity node and siting a community there – sets a precedent that could lead to widespread imitation, which they fear would threaten the character of rural Orange County.”

In a recent opinion piece in the Daily Tar Heel defending the “rural buffer” amid Orange County’s plan-updating process, the author defended it by noting that when the popular ice cream spot Maple View Farms “was bought out in 2021 by a cast of crooks” who “attempted to bastardize the sacred soil of Maple View Farms” with “a hotel and amphitheater with a capacity rivaling the scale of the Durham Performing Arts Center. The one thing that stopped this project from continuing? The Rural Buffer.”

So this “buffer” not only prevents much-needed housing from being built, it also prevents a beloved landmark between Hillsborough and Chapel Hill from expanding and adding more attractions? Victory, I guess (mostly for those who already have the housing they need and don’t like fun).

Because of the difficulty and humiliation in having to deal with “the planners,” many make decisions that allow them to avoid them altogether. A couple years ago, I noticed that a whole stretch of lots in rural Orange County were exactly 10.01 acres and asked a real estate agent friend about why that would be. She explained to me that there is a state law that exempts landowners from most local subdivision and planning requirements if they split the land into lots greater than 10 acres.

In growing urban regions like the Triangle, even if some think farms are beautiful to drive by, agriculture is no longer the “highest and best use” of the land. If a farmer sees that his land value has skyrocketed and wants to sell to a developer to build housing, which has become the highest-and-best use, he can’t, unless he goes to a planning department (who will tell him no, since it would violate rural character).

So instead, he chops his 80-acre farm into eight 10-acre “estate” lots. Does it really “preserve rural character” and save farm land to have these eight lots, owned by people with no interest in farming and who now have to mow massive lawns? Might it not be better for these aims to allow the farmer to sell off 10 one-acre lots and potentially keep the other 70 acres as a farm?

(And a broader question: Would moving that statewide exemption from 10 acres to one acre add a lot more buildable land, thereby reducing building costs and increasing housing stock without major negative tradeoffs? Somebody else can answer that one.)

While my county is fairly extreme on this front, the same principle applies across the state. Officials look out across their jurisdiction like Mufasa from Pride Rock and begin the intoxicating process of planning what should be done with others’ land. “This part of town really should have more woods.” “The lots are too small (or big) on that street.” “A grocery store over there would be kind of an eyesore.” “I like all the farmland I see on my commute. It should stay that way.” And on and on.

But they don’t always consider whether this should be their call to make — whether the Fiddlehead Corner community should have to align with their vision for the county, whether a farmer who wants to buy a bigger farm in a cheaper part of the state should be prevented from selling his land to a housing developer. Yet, somehow these same commissioners frequently bemoan the lack of affordable housing. But a few government-planned “affordable housing” projects cannot make up for all of the private projects that have been blocked. There’s a much easier and cheaper way to make housing affordable: stop trying to control the process and let the market create the housing it needs.

2025-11-02 22:15:00,"The American dream of homeownership, long a symbol of stability, achievement, and upward mobility, is facing unprecedented challenges as the median age of the average first-time homebuyer in the United States has soared to 40 years old, according to newly released data from the National Association of Realtors (NAR). Recommended VideoA year ago, the median age was 38 years old, and that’s up from 36 in 2022, 33 in 2020 and 28 in 1991. “It’s kind of a shocking number,” said Jessica Lautz, deputy chief economist and vice president of research at NAR. “And it’s really been in recent years that we’ve seen this steep climb.”This age milestone marks an era where the affordability crisis is fundamentally reshaping the housing landscape and delaying access to the benefits of homeownership for millions of Americans.As ResiClub editor Lance Lambert contextualized it in a statement to Fortune, this means the first-time homebuyer in 2025 is “just as close in time to the age when they can begin early Social Security withdrawals (age 62) as they are to their high school graduation (age 18).”The NAR’s 2025 Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers, which surveyed recent home transactions between July 2024 and June 2025, also revealed that first-time buyers now comprise just 21% of all home purchases—a historic low.“The historically low share of first-time buyers underscores the real-world consequences of a housing market starved for affordable inventory,” Lautz said. This steep decline—a contraction of 50% since 2007—has significant ripple effects: not only does it delay or deny wealth accumulation for families, but it also means lost opportunities. NAR estimates a 10-year delay in homeownership could mean losing about $150,000 in equity on a typical starter home over a lifetime.New Barriers for Younger BuyersToday’s first-time homebuyers face arduous financial hurdles. The typical down payment is now 10%, matching the highest level recorded since 1989. Most rely on their personal savings (59%), but a significant contingent is tapping financial assets like 401(k)s and investment accounts (26%), while over one in five are depending on gifts or loans from family or friends (22%). This underscores how entry into homeownership has become less accessible for those without substantial family support or generational wealth.In stark contrast, repeat buyers, whose median age is 62, are better positioned—often wielding equity from previous sales for larger down payments, and 30% can buy homes outright with cash. The result is a bifurcated market, where older, established homeowners find mobility and security, while younger would-be buyers wait longer and risk missing out on key wealth-building years. As Fortune has reported, this looks like boomers beating millennials in the competition for housing. If you’re 40 years old, you have to compete with someone your parents’ or aunts and uncles’ age for that elusive starter home, in other words.Societal Shifts and Multigenerational TrendsThe NAR profile also shows that only 24% of buyers have children under the age of 18 at home, yet another all-time low. Meanwhile, the share of Americans buying multigenerational homes, where owners care for aging parents and children moving back after college, has dropped to 14% from 17% in 2024.The crisis has brought housing policy to the forefront of the national conversation. Shannon McGahn, NAR executive vice president and chief advocacy officer, stressed the urgent need to address the underlying causes of the affordability crunch, namely the inadequate supply of homes. She called for policies to unlock existing inventory, revitalize underused properties, streamline zoning and permitting barriers, and modernize construction methods to boost affordable, rapid development. Without such action, the dream of homeownership—and the social mobility it promises—may continue to slip further from reach for ordinary Americans.“For generations, access to homeownership has been the primary way Americans build wealth and the cornerstone of the American Dream,” McGahn said.",https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2025/11/02/local-government-law-attorney-discusses-floridas-housing-affordability-and-property-tax-debate/,"Florida, United States",27.8333,-81.717,46,news4jax.com

San Francisco mayor proposes denser housing to tackle affordability crisis
San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie is pushing to build more homes to address the city's housing crisis

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie is trying to get more homes built for people like Liam Murphy: a fifth-generation city kid who found himself repeatedly outbid for tiny two-bedroom houses that wound up selling for $1.6 million.

Murphy, 39, now lives about an hour's drive away from his job as a San Francisco firefighter. He says it's too late for his family to move back, but he hopes others can stay in a city where the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom is $3,500.

“That would just make for a better city overall,” said Murphy, “and the reason is because city kids just grow up being exposed to more. They're exposed to all the cultures of San Francisco, which makes a more well-rounded person.”

Tiny, colorful San Francisco — just seven miles squared — embraces its image as a city that welcomes all. But its inability to build more housing has made it one of the world's toughest places to find a home, risking the diversity it prides itself on.

Epithets are hurled at the mayor

Lurie hopes to change that, with a plan to allow for denser and taller buildings throughout much of the city, including the westside Sunset neighborhood of single-family homes and the tourist friendly Haight-Ashbury, which is studded with classic Victorian and Edwardian homes.

The issue has roiled the city, and threats of recall loom over San Francisco supervisors who go along with Lurie. At a recent housing rally, the mayor who won a rare reprieve from President Donald Trump's threats to send in federal forces struggled to be heard over angry chants of “shame!” and “liar.”

Protesters demanded the city invest in 100% below-market rate housing and accused him of being a gentrifier and a Republican.

“I truly believe that this has San Franciscans' best interests at heart. Are some people going to be fearful? Absolutely. I get it. Change is scary,” said Lurie, who is a centrist Democrat. “But the status quo is not working. There's an affordability crisis right now.”

Democrats vs Democrats

The city's estimated 830,000 residents are passionate over both land use and equity. Housing projects have died as pressure to create more affordable units made potential developments unprofitable. Residents also want their stunning views.

But San Francisco is under pressure from the state to adopt a new zoning plan allowing for 36,000 more homes by 2031 — or else the state will decide what gets built where — and the mayor likely has the votes to pass his “Family Zoning Plan.”

Supporters say it's a matter of supply and demand, and that more homes will bring down the overall cost of housing.

Critics say such trickle-down economics will not work in a city like San Francisco, which is in such global demand that some foreign investors buy properties sight-unseen. They say developers will only build luxury housing that's too costly for most workers, while displacing tenants and destroying the character of entire neighborhoods.

“There’s a herd of elephants in the room that no one will address,” says Eric Jaye, a Democratic political consultant who opposes the plan.

A city 'for people who didn’t love cities’

Much of the housing push has come from Democrats, including a former city mayor, Gov. Gavin Newsom, who signed into law a proposal by San Francisco state Sen. Scott Wiener to build more homes near transit.

The city has made enormous strides in recent years, with whole districts of tall condo buildings cropping up around downtown, says Rafael Mandelman, president of the Board of Supervisors. But he acknowledges that people come to San Francisco for its more intimate neighborhoods and access to green space.

“San Francisco, historically, was the city for people who didn’t love cities,"" Mandelman said.

Katherine Roberts, 72, initially welcomed construction of an affordable housing complex near the three-story Edwardian she labored to buy in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood two decades ago.

But at 160 units and eight stories high, the massive building has shattered her peace of mind, dominating her view.

“I’m looking out and it’s like I’m living in East Germany. How can you build something this inappropriate in a historic neighborhood like the Haight-Ashbury?” Roberts said. “What about all the people who already live here? What are we supposed to do?”

Proposal calls for denser homes

For the most part, the new zoning plan allows for more housing to be packed into the space of a single-family home — say a duplex with a studio — without exceeding the city's height limit of roughly four stories for such properties. At least 15% of new housing must be below-market rate.

Buildings on neighborhood commercial corridors could double to eight stories. Busier thoroughfares could see high-rises of 10 stories and more, and in a few spots, on Van Ness Avenue, heights could hit 650 feet (200 meters), rivaling some downtown skyscrapers.

Passage of Lurie's proposal won't necessarily lead to more homes in a city with high labor and construction costs and “notoriously complex and cumbersome"" approval processes, as the state said in a scathing 2023 review.

And so city dwellers make do with overcrowded — and sometimes awkward — living situations.

Laura Foote, executive director of “yes in my backyard” YIMBY Action, wound up living with the man who is now her husband — and the woman he was divorcing — in a one-bedroom apartment for about six months, until his ex could find another rental.

“We didn’t kill each other,” Foote said, “but it went on longer than it would have in a well-functioning housing market.”

Mayor's plan is likely to pass

Supervisors are still negotiating amendments to the zoning plan, which could be voted out of committee on Monday for consideration by the full board. Some supervisors want to exempt historic properties, or all buildings currently used for housing. The mayor agreed to exempt buildings with at least three rent-controlled units.

The compromise was a major relief for Phyllis Nabhan, 78, who lives in the Richmond neighborhood, between the Golden Gate Bridge and Golden Gate Park. She fears becoming homeless if a developer scoops up the property she's called home for 47 years, starting with a rent of just $350 a month.

But Nabhan still objects to the proposal. She says it would ruin her neighborhood's “cozy and wonderful” feel, and blames the state for forcing the city to change.

“I think that this mayor is trying,” she said. “It’s a horrible job, I wouldn’t want to be mayor.”

The median age of first-time homebuyers has risen to 40, the highest it has ever been, a sign of the growing problem the United States has with housing affordability.
Not only has the age of first-time homebuyers broken records, but the share of first-time home buyers dropped to a record low of 21%, the National Association of Realtors reported, based on a survey of transactions from July 2024 through June.
SHOULD THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GRADE EVERY STATE AND CITY ON ITS ZONING RULES?
The data released on Monday shows how challenging it has become for younger people to purchase a home and take on a mortgage.
“The historically low share of first-time buyers underscores the real-world consequences of a housing market starved for affordable inventory,” said Jessica Lautz, NAR’s deputy chief economist and vice president of research. “The share of first-time buyers in the market has contracted by 50% since 2007 – right before the Great Recession.”
Lautz described the implications for the housing market as “staggering,” as today’s first-time homebuyers will be building less housing wealth over their lifetimes and will likely have fewer housing moves as a result.
The Tuesday report also found that the median age for all homebuyers is 59 — near the retirement age.
The housing market and troubles with housing affordability and supply have been a top economic issue, particularly after inflation surged following the pandemic and caused the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates, which caused mortgage rates to soar.
As of Tuesday morning, the average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 6.17%, according to Freddie Mac, which tracks rate changes. That is down from a peak above 7% around the start of the year, but is much higher than the ultra-low levels notched in the pandemic.
Notably, there hasn’t been a release on the state of new home sales since September because the government shutdown has halted the release of Census Bureau data. But there was an uptick in sales in August, which is a bit of welcome news for the real estate industry.
New home sales rose 20.5% in August to an 800,000 annual rate, according to the most recent report from the Census Bureau. The number of new home sales is 15.4% higher than in August 2024.
Also, existing home sales rose 1.5% in September, according to the most recent report by the NAR.
Homebuyers have confronted a difficult reality over the past few years. That is because the median sales price of homes has remained high even as mortgage rates rose, representing a double whammy for housing affordability.
Lawmakers have pushed for action on the housing front. For instance, last month, the Senate passed bipartisan housing legislation authored by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott (R-SC) and the top Democrat on the panel, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).The bill, the ROAD to Housing Act of 2025, would rework the federal government’s role in housing and focus on building out the housing supply, which would help with affordability.
The Fed has begun to lower interest rates, which has been another source of relief for homebuyers.
FED RATE CUTS COULD BRING HOUSING RELIEF SOUGHT BY TRUMP
President Donald Trump has frequently criticized Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for holding interest rates so high because the higher rates can make it more expensive to buy a home or finance a car.
In July, Trump criticized Powell for keeping interest rates high, making it “difficult for people, especially the young, to buy a house.”

2025-10-31 10:15:00,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie is trying to get more homes built for people like Liam Murphy: a fifth-generation city kid who found himself repeatedly outbid for tiny two-bedroom houses that wound up selling for $1.6 million.
Murphy, 39, now lives about an hour’s drive away from his job as a San Francisco firefighter. He says it’s too late for his family to move back, but he hopes others can stay in a city where the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom is $3,500.
“That would just make for a better city overall,” said Murphy, “and the reason is because city kids just grow up being exposed to more. They’re exposed to all the cultures of San Francisco, which makes a more well-rounded person.”
Tiny, colorful San Francisco — just seven miles squared — embraces its image as a city that welcomes all. But its inability to build more housing has made it one of the world’s toughest places to find a home, risking the diversity it prides itself on.
Epithets are hurled at the mayor
Lurie hopes to change that, with a plan to allow for denser and taller buildings throughout much of the city, including the westside Sunset neighborhood of single-family homes and the tourist friendly Haight-Ashbury, which is studded with classic Victorian and Edwardian homes.
The issue has roiled the city, and threats of recall loom over San Francisco supervisors who go along with Lurie. At a recent housing rally, the mayor who won a rare reprieve from President Donald Trump’s threats to send in federal forces struggled to be heard over angry chants of “shame!” and “liar.”
Protesters demanded the city invest in 100% below-market rate housing and accused him of being a gentrifier and a Republican.
“I truly believe that this has San Franciscans’ best interests at heart. Are some people going to be fearful? Absolutely. I get it. Change is scary,” said Lurie, who is a centrist Democrat. “But the status quo is not working. There’s an affordability crisis right now.”
Democrats vs Democrats
The city’s estimated 830,000 residents are passionate over both land use and equity. Housing projects have died as pressure to create more affordable units made potential developments unprofitable. Residents also want their stunning views.
But San Francisco is under pressure from the state to adopt a new zoning plan allowing for 36,000 more homes by 2031 — or else the state will decide what gets built where — and the mayor likely has the votes to pass his “Family Zoning Plan.”
Supporters say it’s a matter of supply and demand, and that more homes will bring down the overall cost of housing.
Critics say such trickle-down economics will not work in a city like San Francisco, which is in such global demand that some foreign investors buy properties sight-unseen. They say developers will only build luxury housing that’s too costly for most workers, while displacing tenants and destroying the character of entire neighborhoods.
“There’s a herd of elephants in the room that no one will address,” says Eric Jaye, a Democratic political consultant who opposes the plan.
A city ‘for people who didn’t love cities’
Much of the housing push has come from Democrats, including a former city mayor, Gov. Gavin Newsom, who signed into law a proposal by San Francisco state Sen. Scott Wiener to build more homes near transit.
The city has made enormous strides in recent years, with whole districts of tall condo buildings cropping up around downtown, says Rafael Mandelman, president of the Board of Supervisors. But he acknowledges that people come to San Francisco for its more intimate neighborhoods and access to green space.
“San Francisco, historically, was the city for people who didn’t love cities,” Mandelman said.
Katherine Roberts, 72, initially welcomed construction of an affordable housing complex near the three-story Edwardian she labored to buy in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood two decades ago.
But at 160 units and eight stories high, the massive building has shattered her peace of mind, dominating her view.
“I’m looking out and it’s like I’m living in East Germany. How can you build something this inappropriate in a historic neighborhood like the Haight-Ashbury?” Roberts said. “What about all the people who already live here? What are we supposed to do?”
Proposal calls for denser homes
For the most part, the new zoning plan allows for more housing to be packed into the space of a single-family home — say a duplex with a studio — without exceeding the city’s height limit of roughly four stories for such properties. At least 15% of new housing must be below-market rate.
Buildings on neighborhood commercial corridors could double to eight stories. Busier thoroughfares could see high-rises of 10 stories and more, and in a few spots, on Van Ness Avenue, heights could hit 650 feet (200 meters), rivaling some downtown skyscrapers.
Passage of Lurie’s proposal won’t necessarily lead to more homes in a city with high labor and construction costs and “notoriously complex and cumbersome” approval processes, as the state said in a scathing 2023 review.
And so city dwellers make do with overcrowded — and sometimes awkward — living situations.
Laura Foote, executive director of “yes in my backyard” YIMBY Action, wound up living with the man who is now her husband — and the woman he was divorcing — in a one-bedroom apartment for about six months, until his ex could find another rental.
“We didn’t kill each other,” Foote said, “but it went on longer than it would have in a well-functioning housing market.”
Mayor’s plan is likely to pass
Supervisors are still negotiating amendments to the zoning plan, which could be voted out of committee on Monday for consideration by the full board. Some supervisors want to exempt historic properties, or all buildings currently used for housing. The mayor agreed to exempt buildings with at least three rent-controlled units.
The compromise was a major relief for Phyllis Nabhan, 78, who lives in the Richmond neighborhood, between the Golden Gate Bridge and Golden Gate Park. She fears becoming homeless if a developer scoops up the property she’s called home for 47 years, starting with a rent of just $350 a month.
But Nabhan still objects to the proposal. She says it would ruin her neighborhood’s “cozy and wonderful” feel, and blames the state for forcing the city to change.
“I think that this mayor is trying,” she said. “It’s a horrible job, I wouldn’t want to be mayor.”

2025-10-30 21:30:00,"We’ve all heard the refrain: it’s never been harder to buy your first home. The narrative almost always circles back to two usual suspects – mortgage rates and home prices. While rates and prices are undeniably visible and powerful levers, they are not the whole story.
For industry insiders, the challenge (and the opportunity) lies in understanding the layered, less visible forces shaping affordability for today’s first-time homebuyers. The truth is that affordability isn’t shaped only by where rates land or how quickly prices climb; it’s increasingly a function of a borrower’s balance sheet, monthly cash flow and income, which all factor into debt-to-income ratios (DTI) and ultimately getting approved for a loan.Let’s go beyond the boilerplate and unpack the modern affordability equation, by looking at both macro and micro-level factors.
Rising cost of homeownership
Homeowners’ insurance is emerging as one of the most potent affordability headwinds. Premiums have surged nationwide amid escalating climate risk, catastrophe losses, and carrier pullback, with Florida and California as the most visible flashpoints.
According to Realtor.com (July 8, 2025), average 2025 annual premiums are projected to rise $509 in Florida, $1,320 in California, and an astonishing $2,974 in Louisiana. Those jumps translate to hundreds of dollars added to monthly PITI calculations, enough to push many first-time buyers’ DTI ratios past qualifying limits. In a market where margins are already thin, that can be the deal breaker.
Automated underwriting (AUS) tightening
There is chatter among loan officers that automated underwriting systems have grown restrictive, and seemingly arbitrary. Borrowers who once passed DU or LP are increasingly being pushed into FHA loans, saddling borrowers with steeper mortgage insurance and higher long-term costs. It’s a quiet tightening that reshapes affordability, even for creditworthy applicants.
Today’s borrower profile has shifted
Experian data shows that total consumer debt climbed 2.4% year-over-year, rising from $17.15 trillion in Q3 2023 to $17.57 trillion in Q3 2024. But the real story emerges when you break it down by generation. Gen Z saw their debt balances surge 30.9%, and Millennials increased 5.3%, and these two groups that make up the bulk of today’s first-time homebuyers. For many in these cohorts, carrying $500 to $700 a month in non-mortgage debt is commonplace, leaving less room in the budget for housing costs.
In practical terms, these rising debt loads erode purchasing power and can push DTI ratios past qualifying thresholds, even when income levels appear sufficient on paper.
Further, wage growth has failed to keep pace with home prices, an imbalance now deeply embedded in the housing market. According to USAFacts, home prices have climbed roughly 74% since 2010, while wages have increased only 54% over the same period.
The gap has only widened in recent years: since 2019, median wages are up about 20%, but home prices in many metros have surged 40-60%. The result is a steady erosion of buying power, that even as incomes rise, borrowers simply can’t buy as much house as they once could, leaving many to fall back into the rental cycle.
The devil in the details: DTI as the pressure valve
At the end of the day, affordability is adjudicated through DTI. Lenders and AUS don’t care if the pressure point is insurance premiums, student loans, or credit card balances – it all collapses into a ratio that determines whether a deal gets approved.
Consider this illustrative example:
Household income: $100,000 (~$8,333/month).
Starter home: $350,000 with 3.5% down (FHA).
At a 5.25% rate, P&I runs about $1,898/month. Layer in 20% of income already committed to consumer debts ($1,667), and total monthly obligations hit $3,565 – roughly a 43% DTI.
Now bump the rate to 5.75%: the mortgage payment rises by ~$106, and DTI inches to 44%.
While this is still technically approvable under FHA guidelines, the margin of safety is razor thin. If property taxes, insurance, or MIP are even modestly higher than assumed, the file can tip into denial territory.
This illustrates the real enemy of affordability: not simply rates or prices, but the cumulative drag on DTI from every corner of a borrower’s financial life.
Practical Implications
For originators and lenders, the takeaways are clear:
Build borrower education around the full profile: Homebuyer counseling and education must extend beyond “timing the dip” on rates or home prices (which may in fact promote a costly sidelining of the borrower) to helping borrowers understand the implications of how consumer debt, insurance costs, and MI can shape their buying power.
Highlight the importance of pre-approval: In a market where affordability is fragile, being fully pre-approved gives borrowers the ability to act decisively when conditions align. But in today’s market, the most critical factor to align is inventory; and that’s a story worth its own analysis.
Position as trusted advisors: The LO who can demystify the affordability equation for borrowers will nurture stronger, longer-lasting client relationships.
And perhaps most importantly: don’t overstate the mortgage rate or home price narrative. While these factors are highly visible, they are not the biggest enemy of affordability. The silent factors – insurance, debt loads, and other qualification issues – are what is truly eroding first-time buyers’ access to homeownership.

Busier thoroughfares could see high-rises of 10 stories and more, and in a few spots, on Van Ness Avenue, heights could hit 650 feet (200 meters), rivaling some downtown skyscrapers.Passage of Lurie's proposal won't necessarily lead to more homes in a city with high labor and construction costs and ""notoriously complex and cumbersome"" approval processes, as the state said in a scathing 2023 review.And so city dwellers make do with overcrowded — and sometimes awkward — living situations.Laura Foote, executive director of ""yes in my backyard"" YIMBY Action, wound up living with the man who is now her husband — and the woman he was divorcing — in a one-bedroom apartment for about six months, until his ex could find another rental.""We didn't kill each other,"" Foote said, ""but it went on longer than it would have in a well-functioning housing market.""Mayor's plan is likely to passSupervisors are still negotiating amendments to the zoning plan, which could be voted out of committee on Monday for consideration by the full board. Some supervisors want to exempt historic properties, or all buildings currently used for housing. The mayor agreed to exempt buildings with at least three rent-controlled units.The compromise was a major relief for Phyllis Nabhan, 78, who lives in the Richmond neighborhood, between the Golden Gate Bridge and Golden Gate Park. She fears becoming homeless if a developer scoops up the property she's called home for 47 years, starting with a rent of just $350 a month.But Nabhan still objects to the proposal. She says it would ruin her neighborhood's ""cozy and wonderful"" feel, and blames the state for forcing the city to change.""I think that this mayor is trying,"" she said. ""It's a horrible job, I wouldn't want to be mayor.""

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie is trying to get more homes built for people like Liam Murphy: a fifth-generation city kid who found himself repeatedly outbid for tiny two-bedroom houses that wound up selling for $1.6 million.Murphy, 39, now lives about an hour's drive away from his job as a San Francisco firefighter. He says it's too late for his family to move back, but he hopes others can stay in a city where the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom is $3,500.“That would just make for a better city overall,” said Murphy, “and the reason is because city kids just grow up being exposed to more. They're exposed to all the cultures of San Francisco, which makes a more well-rounded person.”Tiny, colorful San Francisco — just seven miles squared — embraces its image as a city that welcomes all. But its inability to build more housing has made it one of the world's toughest places to find a home, risking the diversity it prides itself on.Epithets are hurled at the mayorLurie hopes to change that, with a plan to allow for denser and taller buildings throughout much of the city, including the westside Sunset neighborhood of single-family homes and the tourist friendly Haight-Ashbury, which is studded with classic Victorian and Edwardian homes.The issue has roiled the city, and threats of recall loom over San Francisco supervisors who go along with Lurie. At a recent housing rally, the mayor who won a rare reprieve from President Donald Trump's threats to send in federal forces struggled to be heard over angry chants of “shame!” and “liar.”Protesters demanded the city invest in 100% below-market rate housing and accused him of being a gentrifier and a Republican.“I truly believe that this has San Franciscans' best interests at heart. Are some people going to be fearful? Absolutely. I get it. Change is scary,” said Lurie, who is a centrist Democrat. “But the status quo is not working. There's an affordability crisis right now.”Democrats vs DemocratsThe city's estimated 830,000 residents are passionate over both land use and equity. Housing projects have died as pressure to create more affordable units made potential developments unprofitable. Residents also want their stunning views.But San Francisco is under pressure from the state to adopt a new zoning plan allowing for 36,000 more homes by 2031 — or else the state will decide what gets built where — and the mayor likely has the votes to pass his “Family Zoning Plan.”Supporters say it's a matter of supply and demand, and that more homes will bring down the overall cost of housing.Critics say such trickle-down economics will not work in a city like San Francisco, which is in such global demand that some foreign investors buy properties sight-unseen. They say developers will only build luxury housing that's too costly for most workers, while displacing tenants and destroying the character of entire neighborhoods.“There’s a herd of elephants in the room that no one will address,” says Eric Jaye, a Democratic political consultant who opposes the plan.A city 'for people who didn’t love cities’Much of the housing push has come from Democrats, including a former city mayor, Gov. Gavin Newsom, who signed into law a proposal by San Francisco state Sen. Scott Wiener to build more homes near transit.

The city has made enormous strides in recent years, with whole districts of tall condo buildings cropping up around downtown, says Rafael Mandelman, president of the Board of Supervisors. But he acknowledges that people come to San Francisco for its more intimate neighborhoods and access to green space.“San Francisco, historically, was the city for people who didn’t love cities,"" Mandelman said.Katherine Roberts, 72, initially welcomed construction of an affordable housing complex near the three-story Edwardian she labored to buy in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood two decades ago.But at 160 units and eight stories high, the massive building has shattered her peace of mind, dominating her view.“I’m looking out and it’s like I’m living in East Germany. How can you build something this inappropriate in a historic neighborhood like the Haight-Ashbury?” Roberts said. “What about all the people who already live here? What are we supposed to do?”Proposal calls for denser homesFor the most part, the new zoning plan allows for more housing to be packed into the space of a single-family home — say a duplex with a studio — without exceeding the city's height limit of roughly four stories for such properties. At least 15% of new housing must be below-market rate.Buildings on neighborhood commercial corridors could double to eight stories. Busier thoroughfares could see high-rises of 10 stories and more, and in a few spots, on Van Ness Avenue, heights could hit 650 feet (200 meters), rivaling some downtown skyscrapers.Passage of Lurie's proposal won't necessarily lead to more homes in a city with high labor and construction costs and “notoriously complex and cumbersome"" approval processes, as the state said in a scathing 2023 review.And so city dwellers make do with overcrowded — and sometimes awkward — living situations.Laura Foote, executive director of “yes in my backyard” YIMBY Action, wound up living with the man who is now her husband — and the woman he was divorcing — in a one-bedroom apartment for about six months, until his ex could find another rental.“We didn’t kill each other,” Foote said, “but it went on longer than it would have in a well-functioning housing market.”Mayor's plan is likely to passSupervisors are still negotiating amendments to the zoning plan, which could be voted out of committee on Monday for consideration by the full board. Some supervisors want to exempt historic properties, or all buildings currently used for housing. The mayor agreed to exempt buildings with at least three rent-controlled units.The compromise was a major relief for Phyllis Nabhan, 78, who lives in the Richmond neighborhood, between the Golden Gate Bridge and Golden Gate Park. She fears becoming homeless if a developer scoops up the property she's called home for 47 years, starting with a rent of just $350 a month.But Nabhan still objects to the proposal. She says it would ruin her neighborhood's “cozy and wonderful” feel, and blames the state for forcing the city to change.“I think that this mayor is trying,” she said. “It’s a horrible job, I wouldn’t want to be mayor.”

He says it's too late for his family to move back, but he hopes others can stay in a city where the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom is $3,500.""That would just make for a better city overall,"" said Murphy, ""and the reason is because city kids just grow up being exposed to more.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie is trying to get more homes built for people like Liam Murphy: a fifth-generation city kid who found himself repeatedly outbid for tiny two-bedroom houses that wound up selling for $1.6 million.

Murphy, 39, now lives about an hour's drive away from his job as a San Francisco firefighter. He says it's too late for his family to move back, but he hopes others can stay in a city where the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom is $3,500.

“That would just make for a better city overall,” said Murphy, “and the reason is because city kids just grow up being exposed to more. They're exposed to all the cultures of San Francisco, which makes a more well-rounded person.”

Tiny, colorful San Francisco — just seven miles squared — embraces its image as a city that welcomes all. But its inability to build more housing has made it one of the world's toughest places to find a home, risking the diversity it prides itself on.

Epithets are hurled at the mayor

Lurie hopes to change that, with a plan to allow for denser and taller buildings throughout much of the city, including the westside Sunset neighborhood of single-family homes and the tourist friendly Haight-Ashbury, which is studded with classic Victorian and Edwardian homes.

The issue has roiled the city, and threats of recall loom over San Francisco supervisors who go along with Lurie. At a recent housing rally, the mayor who won a rare reprieve from President Donald Trump's threats to send in federal forces struggled to be heard over angry chants of “shame!” and “liar.”

Protesters demanded the city invest in 100% below-market rate housing and accused him of being a gentrifier and a Republican.

“I truly believe that this has San Franciscans' best interests at heart. Are some people going to be fearful? Absolutely. I get it. Change is scary,” said Lurie, who is a centrist Democrat. “But the status quo is not working. There's an affordability crisis right now.”

Democrats vs Democrats

The city's estimated 830,000 residents are passionate over both land use and equity. Housing projects have died as pressure to create more affordable units made potential developments unprofitable. Residents also want their stunning views.

But San Francisco is under pressure from the state to adopt a new zoning plan allowing for 36,000 more homes by 2031 — or else the state will decide what gets built where — and the mayor likely has the votes to pass his “Family Zoning Plan.”

Supporters say it's a matter of supply and demand, and that more homes will bring down the overall cost of housing.

Critics say such trickle-down economics will not work in a city like San Francisco, which is in such global demand that some foreign investors buy properties sight-unseen. They say developers will only build luxury housing that's too costly for most workers, while displacing tenants and destroying the character of entire neighborhoods.

“There’s a herd of elephants in the room that no one will address,” says Eric Jaye, a Democratic political consultant who opposes the plan.

A city 'for people who didn’t love cities’

Much of the housing push has come from Democrats, including a former city mayor, Gov. Gavin Newsom, who signed into law a proposal by San Francisco state Sen. Scott Wiener to build more homes near transit.

The city has made enormous strides in recent years, with whole districts of tall condo buildings cropping up around downtown, says Rafael Mandelman, president of the Board of Supervisors. But he acknowledges that people come to San Francisco for its more intimate neighborhoods and access to green space.

“San Francisco, historically, was the city for people who didn’t love cities,"" Mandelman said.

Katherine Roberts, 72, initially welcomed construction of an affordable housing complex near the three-story Edwardian she labored to buy in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood two decades ago.

But at 160 units and eight stories high, the massive building has shattered her peace of mind, dominating her view.

“I’m looking out and it’s like I’m living in East Germany. How can you build something this inappropriate in a historic neighborhood like the Haight-Ashbury?” Roberts said. “What about all the people who already live here? What are we supposed to do?”

Proposal calls for denser homes

For the most part, the new zoning plan allows for more housing to be packed into the space of a single-family home — say a duplex with a studio — without exceeding the city's height limit of roughly four stories for such properties. At least 15% of new housing must be below-market rate.

Buildings on neighborhood commercial corridors could double to eight stories. Busier thoroughfares could see high-rises of 10 stories and more, and in a few spots, on Van Ness Avenue, heights could hit 650 feet (200 meters), rivaling some downtown skyscrapers.

Passage of Lurie's proposal won't necessarily lead to more homes in a city with high labor and construction costs and “notoriously complex and cumbersome"" approval processes, as the state said in a scathing 2023 review.

And so city dwellers make do with overcrowded — and sometimes awkward — living situations.

Laura Foote, executive director of “yes in my backyard” YIMBY Action, wound up living with the man who is now her husband — and the woman he was divorcing — in a one-bedroom apartment for about six months, until his ex could find another rental.

“We didn’t kill each other,” Foote said, “but it went on longer than it would have in a well-functioning housing market.”

Mayor's plan is likely to pass

Supervisors are still negotiating amendments to the zoning plan, which could be voted out of committee on Monday for consideration by the full board. Some supervisors want to exempt historic properties, or all buildings currently used for housing. The mayor agreed to exempt buildings with at least three rent-controlled units.

The compromise was a major relief for Phyllis Nabhan, 78, who lives in the Richmond neighborhood, between the Golden Gate Bridge and Golden Gate Park. She fears becoming homeless if a developer scoops up the property she's called home for 47 years, starting with a rent of just $350 a month.

But Nabhan still objects to the proposal. She says it would ruin her neighborhood's “cozy and wonderful” feel, and blames the state for forcing the city to change.

“I think that this mayor is trying,” she said. “It’s a horrible job, I wouldn’t want to be mayor.”

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie is trying to get more homes built for people like Liam Murphy: a fifth-generation city kid who found himself repeatedly outbid for tiny two-bedroom houses that wound up selling for $1.6 million.
Murphy, 39, now lives about an hour’s drive away from his job as a San Francisco firefighter. He says it’s too late for his family to move back, but he hopes others can stay in a city where the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom is $3,500.
“That would just make for a better city overall,” said Murphy, “and the reason is because city kids just grow up being exposed to more. They’re exposed to all the cultures of San Francisco, which makes a more well-rounded person.”
Tiny, colorful San Francisco — just seven miles squared — embraces its image as a city that welcomes all. But its inability to build more housing has made it one of the world’s toughest places to find a home, risking the diversity it prides itself on.
Epithets are hurled at the mayor
Lurie hopes to change that, with a plan to allow for denser and taller buildings throughout much of the city, including the westside Sunset neighborhood of single-family homes and the tourist friendly Haight-Ashbury, which is studded with classic Victorian and Edwardian homes.
The issue has roiled the city, and threats of recall loom over San Francisco supervisors who go along with Lurie. At a recent housing rally, the mayor who won a rare reprieve from President Donald Trump’s threats to send in federal forces struggled to be heard over angry chants of “shame!” and “liar.”
Protesters demanded the city invest in 100% below-market rate housing and accused him of being a gentrifier and a Republican.
“I truly believe that this has San Franciscans’ best interests at heart. Are some people going to be fearful? Absolutely. I get it. Change is scary,” said Lurie, who is a centrist Democrat. “But the status quo is not working. There’s an affordability crisis right now.”
Democrats vs Democrats
The city’s estimated 830,000 residents are passionate over both land use and equity. Housing projects have died as pressure to create more affordable units made potential developments unprofitable. Residents also want their stunning views.
But San Francisco is under pressure from the state to adopt a new zoning plan allowing for 36,000 more homes by 2031 — or else the state will decide what gets built where — and the mayor likely has the votes to pass his “Family Zoning Plan.”
Supporters say it’s a matter of supply and demand, and that more homes will bring down the overall cost of housing.
Critics say such trickle-down economics will not work in a city like San Francisco, which is in such global demand that some foreign investors buy properties sight-unseen. They say developers will only build luxury housing that’s too costly for most workers, while displacing tenants and destroying the character of entire neighborhoods.
“There’s a herd of elephants in the room that no one will address,” says Eric Jaye, a Democratic political consultant who opposes the plan.
A city ‘for people who didn’t love cities’
Much of the housing push has come from Democrats, including a former city mayor, Gov. Gavin Newsom, who signed into law a proposal by San Francisco state Sen. Scott Wiener to build more homes near transit.
The city has made enormous strides in recent years, with whole districts of tall condo buildings cropping up around downtown, says Rafael Mandelman, president of the Board of Supervisors. But he acknowledges that people come to San Francisco for its more intimate neighborhoods and access to green space.
“San Francisco, historically, was the city for people who didn’t love cities,” Mandelman said.
Katherine Roberts, 72, initially welcomed construction of an affordable housing complex near the three-story Edwardian she labored to buy in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood two decades ago.
But at 160 units and eight stories high, the massive building has shattered her peace of mind, dominating her view.
“I’m looking out and it’s like I’m living in East Germany. How can you build something this inappropriate in a historic neighborhood like the Haight-Ashbury?” Roberts said. “What about all the people who already live here? What are we supposed to do?”
Proposal calls for denser homes
For the most part, the new zoning plan allows for more housing to be packed into the space of a single-family home — say a duplex with a studio — without exceeding the city’s height limit of roughly four stories for such properties. At least 15% of new housing must be below-market rate.
Buildings on neighborhood commercial corridors could double to eight stories. Busier thoroughfares could see high-rises of 10 stories and more, and in a few spots, on Van Ness Avenue, heights could hit 650 feet (200 meters), rivaling some downtown skyscrapers.
Passage of Lurie’s proposal won’t necessarily lead to more homes in a city with high labor and construction costs and “notoriously complex and cumbersome” approval processes, as the state said in a scathing 2023 review.
And so city dwellers make do with overcrowded — and sometimes awkward — living situations.
Laura Foote, executive director of “yes in my backyard” YIMBY Action, wound up living with the man who is now her husband — and the woman he was divorcing — in a one-bedroom apartment for about six months, until his ex could find another rental.
“We didn’t kill each other,” Foote said, “but it went on longer than it would have in a well-functioning housing market.”
Mayor’s plan is likely to pass
Supervisors are still negotiating amendments to the zoning plan, which could be voted out of committee on Monday for consideration by the full board. Some supervisors want to exempt historic properties, or all buildings currently used for housing. The mayor agreed to exempt buildings with at least three rent-controlled units.
The compromise was a major relief for Phyllis Nabhan, 78, who lives in the Richmond neighborhood, between the Golden Gate Bridge and Golden Gate Park. She fears becoming homeless if a developer scoops up the property she’s called home for 47 years, starting with a rent of just $350 a month.
But Nabhan still objects to the proposal. She says it would ruin her neighborhood’s “cozy and wonderful” feel, and blames the state for forcing the city to change.
“I think that this mayor is trying,” she said. “It’s a horrible job, I wouldn’t want to be mayor.”",https://www.gjsentinel.com/news/us/san-francisco-mayor-proposes-denser-housing-to-tackle-affordability-crisis/article_3f9ac4b1-f1f5-5c6a-a623-2d62f57f284b.html,"Haight-Ashbury, California, United States",37.7699,-122.447,2,gjsentinel.com

Senior Living Operators Embrace PACE as ‘Missing Link’ for Affordability, Clinical Services

A growing number of senior living providers are expanding Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) services to meet the needs of incoming – and potentially cash-strapped older adults.
Rising resident acuity, affordability issues and shifting expectations among older adults are all issues that operators believe PACE can aid.
While such services and partnerships remain relatively niche, senior living providers view PACE services differently in 2025. Greater recognition of PACE services as an operational differentiator began in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic as providers worked to extend services and connect with older adults outside their communities.
Senior living providers including Immanuel, EveryAge and Health Dimensions Group (HDG) believe PACE services could be the “missing link” between clinical integration and social support to improve quality of life for older adults outside traditional senior living settings. Currently, HDG is a PACE consulting organization along with serving as a National PACE Association Technical Assistance Center.
“The PACE center is where people thrive,” said Immanuel CEO Eric Gurley. “They can socialize, be engaged and do activities and it’s important that we remember this forgotten population by and large.”
This comes as the National PACE Association reported rapid growth in 2024 when 24 new PACE programs opened, triple the historical annual average, according to National PACE Association CEO Shawn Bloom.
“What we’re seeing is unprecedented interest in PACE, particularly among organizations that want to sponsor PACE as a service delivery model in their communities,” Bloom told SHN.
EveryAge, a North Carolina-based nonprofit, has seen more seniors who can’t afford private-pay options turn to PACE to access comprehensive services while remaining in their communities.
Over 11.5 million older Americans aged 75 and up will be unable to afford assisted living in the coming decade, according to the “Forgotten Middle” affordability study by NORC at the University of Chicago.
In 2025, seven new PACE programs have opened, with more “on the cusp” of opening soon, Bloom added. But challenges remain in growing PACE partnerships in senior living due to a complex mix of issues, including an uneven patchwork of state-specific regulations, prohibitive startup costs and eligibility factors that make adoption tougher.
Benefits of PACE
PACE organizations establish networks of providers to deliver a full continuum of services that meet participants’ healthcare needs. When participants live in or require assisted living care, the PACE organization contracts with an assisted living facility to provide a comprehensive package of services. As part of the partnership, PACE is responsible for payment of all required services in assisted living, Bloom said.
Omaha, Nebraska-based nonprofit senior living provider Immanuel uses its PACE partnership to “close the clinical gap” and address the clinical, emotional and social needs of residents under a unified model, according to CEO Eric Gurley. He describes PACE as a return to “true continuum thinking,” combining person-centered senior living values with clinical expertise.
“At the time, it was a novel idea,” Gurley said of launching PACE centers. “Now, as we see systems evolving, it’s clear that taking that step back then was truly courageous.”
Staff often tailor their approach to meet participants’ preferences — for example, building rapport through small daily gestures that help earn trust before providing in-home services, Gurley said.
EveryAge, based in North Carolina, operates three PACE centers across the Tar Heel State near affordable housing communities to support low-income seniors’ ability to age in place. EveryAge staff lead extensive community outreach efforts by partnering with local organizations to educate and identify eligible seniors, EveryAge Director of Home- and Community-Based Services Thomas Chang told SHN.
“Our goal in senior living is to provide a variety of environments for home and health that accommodate older adults in different phases of life,” Chang told SHN.
These partnerships have reduced unscheduled hospitalizations and emergency department visits while strengthening ties with local communities, he added. Through PACE’s interdisciplinary care model, assisted living operations benefit from coordinated care, clinical planning and risk management, making PACE a strong partner for assisted living providers, according to Health Dimensions Group Senior Vice President of Consulting Services Tom Stitt.
“It’s the full continuum of services in one package,” Stitt said. “PACE has a proven track record of improving the mental and physical health of participants. Senior living communities will hopefully see this in their residents enrolled in PACE.”
Close engagement between PACE and assisted living staff at the community level can help identify PACE-eligible participants, bringing additional scale and more resources for programming and engagement opportunities, Chang said. Through ongoing health monitoring and intervention, PACE partnerships have made a positive clinical impact while improving social ties among residents and more introverted, at-home older adults.
What drives PACE expansion
State regulation changes, affordability pressures and increased demand for community-based services are pushing senior living providers to align with and host PACE programs. At the national level, PACE advocates are working to reintroduce and pass the Duals Act and the Part D Choice Act, which would allow older adults to maintain Part D Medicaid.
“While there have been significant improvements in the affordability of Part D… it still costs roughly $4,700 a month,” Bloom said. “I don’t know how long most seniors could afford to do that, even though it is far less than institutional care.”
Co-location of PACE and senior housing can create significant cost efficiencies for the PACE program and provide much needed care coordination for senior living communities and their low-income residents, Stitt said
Technology integration also helps capture better data for social group meetings and program attendance, Gurley said, calling it a chance for operations teams from different backgrounds to build relationships and better understand the communities they serve.
The future of senior living as a hub for PACE centers
As senior living providers expand their high-acuity care models, PACE partnerships could continue to drive clinical and operational innovation as residents delay entry into senior living and present with higher acuity needs.
“Incorporating PACE programs into our portfolio has diversified the revenue stream and allowed us to see how other models address the needs of seniors,” Chang said.
In the future, Gurley believes that PACE services and partners could serve as a gateway for future Medicare Advantage plans on a capitated risk basis to take on greater risk and advance value-based care efforts in senior living.
“We have the skill set because we’re the provider, not just the insurer,” Gurley added.
As care needs become more complex, Bloom envisions a world where PACE centers and senior living operators work more closely to reach new groups of older adults living at home who need valuable programming, social connection and care delivery.
“The value added by PACE integration is among the most important improvements we can make to an older individual’s ability to live with dignity and independence,” Bloom said.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie is trying to get more homes built for people like Liam Murphy: a fifth-generation city kid who found himself repeatedly outbid for tiny two-bedroom houses that wound up selling for $1.6 million.
Murphy, 39, now lives about an hour’s drive away from his job as a San Francisco firefighter. He says it’s too late for his family to move back, but he hopes others can stay in a city where the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom is $3,500.
“That would just make for a better city overall,” said Murphy, “and the reason is because city kids just grow up being exposed to more. They’re exposed to all the cultures of San Francisco, which makes a more well-rounded person.”

Tiny, colorful San Francisco — just seven miles squared — embraces its image as a city that welcomes all. But its inability to build more housing has made it one of the world’s toughest places to find a home, risking the diversity it prides itself on.
Epithets are hurled at the mayor
Lurie hopes to change that, with a plan to allow for denser and taller buildings throughout much of the city, including the westside Sunset neighborhood of single-family homes and the tourist friendly Haight-Ashbury, which is studded with classic Victorian and Edwardian homes.
The issue has roiled the city, and threats of recall loom over San Francisco supervisors who go along with Lurie. At a recent housing rally, the mayor who won a rare reprieve from President Donald Trump’s threats to send in federal forces struggled to be heard over angry chants of “shame!” and “liar.”
Protesters demanded the city invest in 100% below-market rate housing and accused him of being a gentrifier and a Republican.
“I truly believe that this has San Franciscans’ best interests at heart. Are some people going to be fearful? Absolutely. I get it. Change is scary,” said Lurie, who is a centrist Democrat. “But the status quo is not working. There’s an affordability crisis right now.”
Democrats vs Democrats
The city’s estimated 830,000 residents are passionate over both land use and equity. Housing projects have died as pressure to create more affordable units made potential developments unprofitable. Residents also want their stunning views.
But San Francisco is under pressure from the state to adopt a new zoning plan allowing for 36,000 more homes by 2031 — or else the state will decide what gets built where — and the mayor likely has the votes to pass his “Family Zoning Plan.”
Supporters say it’s a matter of supply and demand, and that more homes will bring down the overall cost of housing.
Critics say such trickle-down economics will not work in a city like San Francisco, which is in such global demand that some foreign investors buy properties sight-unseen. They say developers will only build luxury housing that’s too costly for most workers, while displacing tenants and destroying the character of entire neighborhoods.
“There’s a herd of elephants in the room that no one will address,” says Eric Jaye, a Democratic political consultant who opposes the plan.
A city ‘for people who didn’t love cities’
Much of the housing push has come from Democrats, including a former city mayor, Gov. Gavin Newsom, who signed into law a proposal by San Francisco state Sen. Scott Wiener to build more homes near transit.
The city has made enormous strides in recent years, with whole districts of tall condo buildings cropping up around downtown, says Rafael Mandelman, president of the Board of Supervisors. But he acknowledges that people come to San Francisco for its more intimate neighborhoods and access to green space.
“San Francisco, historically, was the city for people who didn’t love cities,” Mandelman said.
Katherine Roberts, 72, initially welcomed construction of an affordable housing complex near the three-story Edwardian she labored to buy in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood two decades ago.
But at 160 units and eight stories high, the massive building has shattered her peace of mind, dominating her view.
“I’m looking out and it’s like I’m living in East Germany. How can you build something this inappropriate in a historic neighborhood like the Haight-Ashbury?” Roberts said. “What about all the people who already live here? What are we supposed to do?”
Proposal calls for denser homes
For the most part, the new zoning plan allows for more housing to be packed into the space of a single-family home — say a duplex with a studio — without exceeding the city’s height limit of roughly four stories for such properties. At least 15% of new housing must be below-market rate.
Buildings on neighborhood commercial corridors could double to eight stories. Busier thoroughfares could see high-rises of 10 stories and more, and in a few spots, on Van Ness Avenue, heights could hit 650 feet (200 meters), rivaling some downtown skyscrapers.
Passage of Lurie’s proposal won’t necessarily lead to more homes in a city with high labor and construction costs and “notoriously complex and cumbersome” approval processes, as the state said in a scathing 2023 review.
And so city dwellers make do with overcrowded — and sometimes awkward — living situations.
Laura Foote, executive director of “yes in my backyard” YIMBY Action, wound up living with the man who is now her husband — and the woman he was divorcing — in a one-bedroom apartment for about six months, until his ex could find another rental.
“We didn’t kill each other,” Foote said, “but it went on longer than it would have in a well-functioning housing market.”

Mayor’s plan is likely to pass
Supervisors are still negotiating amendments to the zoning plan, which could be voted out of committee on Monday for consideration by the full board. Some supervisors want to exempt historic properties, or all buildings currently used for housing. The mayor agreed to exempt buildings with at least three rent-controlled units.
The compromise was a major relief for Phyllis Nabhan, 78, who lives in the Richmond neighborhood, between the Golden Gate Bridge and Golden Gate Park. She fears becoming homeless if a developer scoops up the property she’s called home for 47 years, starting with a rent of just $350 a month.
But Nabhan still objects to the proposal. She says it would ruin her neighborhood’s “cozy and wonderful” feel, and blames the state for forcing the city to change.
“I think that this mayor is trying,” she said. “It’s a horrible job, I wouldn’t want to be mayor.”

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie is trying to get more homes built for people like Liam Murphy: a fifth-generation city kid who found himself repeatedly outbid for tiny two-bedroom houses that wound up selling for $1.6 million.Murphy, 39, now lives about an hour's drive away from his job as a San Francisco firefighter. He says it's too late for his family to move back, but he hopes others can stay in a city where the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom is $3,500.“That would just make for a better city overall,” said Murphy, “and the reason is because city kids just grow up being exposed to more. They're exposed to all the cultures of San Francisco, which makes a more well-rounded person.”Tiny, colorful San Francisco — just seven miles squared — embraces its image as a city that welcomes all. But its inability to build more housing has made it one of the world's toughest places to find a home, risking the diversity it prides itself on.Epithets are hurled at the mayorLurie hopes to change that, with a plan to allow for denser and taller buildings throughout much of the city, including the westside Sunset neighborhood of single-family homes and the tourist friendly Haight-Ashbury, which is studded with classic Victorian and Edwardian homes.The issue has roiled the city, and threats of recall loom over San Francisco supervisors who go along with Lurie. At a recent housing rally, the mayor who won a rare reprieve from President Donald Trump's threats to send in federal forces struggled to be heard over angry chants of “shame!” and “liar.”Protesters demanded the city invest in 100% below-market rate housing and accused him of being a gentrifier and a Republican.“I truly believe that this has San Franciscans' best interests at heart. Are some people going to be fearful? Absolutely. I get it. Change is scary,” said Lurie, who is a centrist Democrat. “But the status quo is not working.

Fed Slashes Rates Again — Here’s How It Could Affect Housing Affordability

The Federal Reserve announced its second interest rate cut of the year on Wednesday, reducing the benchmark rate by a quarter-point to lower the target range to 3.75%-4.00%.
The decision, made by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) after a two-day meeting, follows a quarter-point reduction in September. The move comes amid softer labor market conditions and a federal government shutdown that has stalled most economic data releases.“Falling interest rates will help America’s small businesses access the credit they need to capitalize on the strong economic momentum created by President Trump and Congressional Republicans’ pro-growth policies,” Job Creators Network CEO Alfredo Ortiz told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “With inflation tamed, gas prices at their lowest level in years, record stock market highs, and the Big Beautiful Bill’s tax cuts fueling expansion, the economy is well-positioned for continued growth,” Ortiz added. “This rate cut will empower small businesses to expand, hire, invest, and drive America’s economic resurgence to even greater heights.” (RELATED: SCOTT TURNER: At HUD, Homes and Healthcare Financing Are On The Line During Shutdown)

(Photo by JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images) The cut comes against a backdrop of weakening jobs data. The most recent available report, for August, showed just  22,000 jobs added, while Bureau of Labor Statistics revisions revealed 911,000 fewer jobs created over the prior year than previously estimated.
The September employment report, typically released in early October, remains unpublished due to the shutdown. The only major data point issued since the impasse began was Friday’s Consumer Price Index, which showed annual inflation rising 3% in September, below forecasts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, speaking on Oct. 14, acknowledged the data vacuum but noted the central bank continues to monitor an array of public and private-sector indicators, stating that the “outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting.” Powell added that while recent economic data have come in stronger than expected, it hasn’t yet translated into renewed hiring strength.
“You do have a bit of tension between labor market data – we see very low levels of job creation – and yet people are spending,” Powell said. “We are going to have to see how that plays out.” Economists broadly anticipate a third quarter-point cut at the Fed’s December meeting, which would bring the federal funds rate 0.75 percentage points lower by year-end than it stood in January. “Inflation has been surprisingly sticky, but is coming down and will continue to come down. Thus, a series of quarter-point cuts until the funds rate is approaching 3% seems appropriate,” JD Foster, former chief economist at the Office of Management and Budget, told the DCNF. “As the economy appears to remain on pretty solid footing, there’s no real need to move more quickly.” Mortgage rates — which the Fed does not directly control but are strongly influenced by its actions — have already fallen in anticipation. Freddie Mac reported the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6.19% as of Oct. 23, down from 6.5% a year earlier. Yet, further relief to homebuyers may be limited. “Markets are forward-looking and have already priced in the likelihood of additional cuts,” Tobias Peter, co-director at the American Enterprise Institute’s Housing Center, told the DCNF. “Rates have come down quite a bit from a year ago, so another quarter-point move may not shift the needle much.” At around 6%, many existing homeowners remain locked into lower-rate mortgages and are reluctant to sell, constricting supply. Housing affordability has become a key focus for the Trump administration, as only 28% of homes in the market are affordable for the average household, according to Realtor.com. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated in September that the administration may declare a national housing emergency, while President Donald Trump has also floated ideas like eliminating capital gains taxes on home sales. Foster, however, voiced skepticism about such tax changes. “Few home sellers pay capital gains tax because they roll their equity into their next home. And for those few who might face a tax, what happens? The same thing that happens whenever you cut the tax on an asset — the asset price rises,” Foster said. “That’s not making housing more affordable.” Foster argued the most effective lever remains lower interest rates, saying, “Bring down mortgage rates and, over time, local housing markets will return to normal in terms of supply.” Peter said that while many solutions to the affordable housing crisis must come from state and local governments, such as zoning reform, there are also meaningful steps that can be taken at the federal level. For example, he suggested that the Bureau of Land Management could sell land located within one to five miles of existing development. “Over the span of 10 years, we think that could easily add up to a million new housing units,” Peter said. He also urged the administration to use its bully pulpit to promote reforms such as reducing minimum lot sizes, lowering taxes for small-scale developers, and easing restrictions on manufactured homes, measures he said could significantly boost the housing supply.

San Francisco pushes bold housing plan to tackle affordability crisis
The Associated Press//October 30, 2025//
Listen to this article
The Blueprint
Mayor Daniel Lurie proposes denser housing to ease San Francisco‘s affordability crisis.
The plan would allow taller buildings citywide, including historic areas.
Critics fear displacement and loss of neighborhood character.
The state is pressuring San Francisco to approve 36,000 new homes by 2031.
SAN FRANCISCO — San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie is trying to get more homes built for people like Liam Murphy: a fifth-generation city kid who found himself repeatedly outbid for tiny two-bedroom houses that wound up selling for $1.6 million.
Murphy, 39, now lives about an hour’s drive away from his job as a San Francisco firefighter. He says it’s too late for his family to move back, but he hopes others can stay in a city where the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom is $3,500.
“That would just make for a better city overall,” said Murphy, “and the reason is because city kids just grow up being exposed to more. They’re exposed to all the cultures of San Francisco, which makes a more well-rounded person.”
Tiny, colorful San Francisco — just seven miles squared — embraces its image as a city that welcomes all. But its inability to build more housing has made it one of the world’s toughest places to find a home, risking the diversity it prides itself on.
Epithets are hurled at the mayor
Lurie hopes to change that, with a plan to allow for denser and taller buildings throughout much of the city, including the westside Sunset neighborhood of single-family homes and the tourist friendly Haight-Ashbury, which is studded with classic Victorian and Edwardian homes.
The issue has roiled the city, and threats of recall loom over San Francisco supervisors who go along with Lurie. At a recent housing rally, the mayor who won a rare reprieve from President Donald Trump’s threats to send in federal forces struggled to be heard over angry chants of “shame!” and “liar.”
Protesters demanded the city invest in 100% below-market rate housing and accused him of being a gentrifier and a Republican.
“I truly believe that this has San Franciscans’ best interests at heart. Are some people going to be fearful? Absolutely. I get it. Change is scary,” said Lurie, who is a centrist Democrat. “But the status quo is not working. There’s an affordability crisis right now.”
Democrats vs. Democrats
The city’s estimated 830,000 residents are passionate over both land use and equity. Housing projects have died as pressure to create more affordable units made potential developments unprofitable. Residents also want their stunning views.
But San Francisco is under pressure from the state to adopt a new zoning plan allowing for 36,000 more homes by 2031 — or else the state will decide what gets built where — and the mayor likely has the votes to pass his “Family Zoning Plan.”
Supporters say it’s a matter of supply and demand, and that more homes will bring down the overall cost of housing.
Critics say such trickle-down economics will not work in a city like San Francisco, which is in such global demand that some foreign investors buy properties sight-unseen. They say developers will only build luxury housing that’s too costly for most workers, while displacing tenants and destroying the character of entire neighborhoods.
“There’s a herd of elephants in the room that no one will address,” says Eric Jaye, a Democratic political consultant who opposes the plan.
A city ‘for people who didn’t love cities’
Much of the housing push has come from Democrats, including a former city mayor, Gov. Gavin Newsom, who signed into law a proposal by San Francisco state Sen. Scott Wiener to build more homes near transit.
The city has made enormous strides in recent years, with whole districts of tall condo buildings cropping up around downtown, says Rafael Mandelman, president of the Board of Supervisors. But he acknowledges that people come to San Francisco for its more intimate neighborhoods and access to green space.
“San Francisco, historically, was the city for people who didn’t love cities,” Mandelman said.
Katherine Roberts, 72, initially welcomed construction of an affordable housing complex near the three-story Edwardian she labored to buy in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood two decades ago.
But at 160 units and eight stories high, the massive building has shattered her peace of mind, dominating her view.
“I’m looking out and it’s like I’m living in East Germany. How can you build something this inappropriate in a historic neighborhood like the Haight-Ashbury?” Roberts said. “What about all the people who already live here? What are we supposed to do?”
Proposal calls for denser homes
For the most part, the new zoning plan allows for more housing to be packed into the space of a single-family home — say a duplex with a studio — without exceeding the city’s height limit of roughly four stories for such properties. At least 15% of new housing must be below-market rate.
Buildings on neighborhood commercial corridors could double to eight stories. Busier thoroughfares could see high-rises of 10 stories and more, and in a few spots, on Van Ness Avenue, heights could hit 650 feet, rivaling some downtown skyscrapers.
Passage of Lurie’s proposal won’t necessarily lead to more homes in a city with high labor and construction costs and “notoriously complex and cumbersome” approval processes, as the state said in a scathing 2023 review.
And so city dwellers make do with overcrowded — and sometimes awkward — living situations.
Laura Foote, executive director of “yes in my backyard” YIMBY Action, wound up living with the man who is now her husband — and the woman he was divorcing — in a one-bedroom apartment for about six months, until his ex could find another rental.
“We didn’t kill each other,” Foote said, “but it went on longer than it would have in a well-functioning housing market.”
Mayor’s plan is likely to pass
Supervisors are still negotiating amendments to the zoning plan, which could be voted out of committee on Monday for consideration by the full board. Some supervisors want to exempt historic properties, or all buildings currently used for housing. The mayor agreed to exempt buildings with at least three rent-controlled units.
The compromise was a major relief for Phyllis Nabhan, 78, who lives in the Richmond neighborhood, between the Golden Gate Bridge and Golden Gate Park. She fears becoming homeless if a developer scoops up the property she’s called home for 47 years, starting with a rent of just $350 a month.
But Nabhan still objects to the proposal. She says it would ruin her neighborhood’s “cozy and wonderful” feel, and blames the state for forcing the city to change.
“I think that this mayor is trying,” she said. “It’s a horrible job, I wouldn’t want to be mayor.”

Santa Monica, Calif.
Tricia Crane stands at the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and 26th Street in Santa Monica, a few blocks from her home, pointing out a stretch of businesses that will be replaced with a 170-unit apartment building.A Starbucks has already closed; a store selling chairs and mattresses is still open, but not for much longer. This block just 2 miles from the beach is scheduled to be redeveloped in January.Facing a budget crisis and a state mandate to create more housing, members of the City Council, she says, are “just doing whatever they can” to get more units built.
Why We Wrote This
One answer to an affordability gap in housing, experts say, is building more units to try to ease the pressure on prices. That can mean changing laws that regulate where and what kinds of housing can be built.
The eight-story building will stand out among its mostly one-to-three-story neighbors. It’s one of a half dozen developments that will add over 1,000 units to this coastal city of 91,000 people next to Los Angeles.Average monthly rent is about $3,500 here, among the highest in the United States. Ms. Crane is concerned that the addition of these market-rate units in the highly desirable beach community won’t do anything to bring prices down. “We are losing our middle class,” she says.But these are the type of projects that pro-housing advocates hope to see more of, and California is making them easier to build. Over the past few months, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a slate of laws aimed at eliminating a deficit of 2.5 million housing units. In support of more and denser housing, lawmakers relaxed the state’s landmark environmental rules, cleared the way for multiunit housing near transit hubs, streamlined building permits, created new funding programs for developers, and increased tax credits for renters.

The laws are, in part, designed to promote units that are affordable – generally defined as costing no more than 30% of a family’s income. They move California in the right direction, says Sherri Lawson Clark, a cultural anthropologist at Wake Forest University who studies housing and poverty. If California – where midtier homes cost more than twice the nationwide average – can narrow the affordability gap with an influx of new housing, then it could “perhaps be a blueprint for other states and localities,” she says.

Tricia Crane stands a few blocks from her home in front of a half-shuttered commercial building that is scheduled to be replaced with a 170-unit apartment building, Oct. 9, 2025, in Santa Monica, California.
The Golden State’s effort faces significant obstacles. Factors like the high cost of construction, concentration of relatively high earners, and high interest rates affect how much it costs to build, buy, and rent units – which directly impacts their accessibility. In fact, California has enacted a series of reforms over the last decade, only for the crisis to persist.A recent study by the McKinsey Institute for Economic Mobility estimates the U.S. is short 8.2 million housing units – 32% more than 10 years ago, despite decades in which laws have often moved toward more streamlined permitting and denser housing. The limited supply, says the report, has kept rents and home prices high.California’s need for more housing units, plus a growing disparity between income and housing costs, calls for a “both/and” solution, says William Fulton, professor of practice at the University of California, San Diego’s department of urban studies and planning. “You have to build way more housing” in general, he says. “But you also need to build as much affordable housing as you can.”New laws could change California landscapeA long-standing state law requires cities to have plans for meeting projected housing needs, and to update those plans every few years. About two-thirds of Santa Monica’s existing housing stock is in buildings with five or more units, according to a 2023 analysis by the Santa Monica Daily Press. The city’s building target is nearly 9,000 new units by 2030. Just over a third of that – 3,400 – has been completed. Nearly all of it is in multifamily or mixed-use buildings.The new law that allows for more housing near transit hubs clears the way for high-rises of up to nine stories, and overrides any local ordinances.

Most Americans have avoided shutdown woes. That might change.
The wide-ranging reforms reflect the complexities of housing affordability.“There isn’t a silver bullet here,” says Mr. Fulton. Homes get built at the market’s highest end, where profits are higher, and at the very low end, because that construction is subsidized. But “very little new housing is being built” for people making $100,000 a year, he says. “That’s a very complex spot to be in. ... Rents are going up, and they’re the ones who are really getting squeezed.”Only 15% of Californians can afford to buy a median-priced single-family home in their state, according to the California Association of Realtors. In 2012, it was 56%.Adding market-rate units, even at the high end, helps ease the shortage and expand affordable options, says Mr. Fulton. As people move into more expensive homes, their less expensive units free up for others to move into.

This push to expand the kinds of housing available in California communities could reframe the California dream, as condominium and apartment buildings gain legislative support to outpace single-family homes like the ranch, Craftsman, and Spanish bungalows found throughout the LA area.And one significant obstacle to building condos and apartments no longer exists. Faced with the loss of thousands of homes in the LA wildfires, plus the increasing crisis of affordability, lawmakers agreed on limited reforms that ease restrictions on denser building where infrastructure already exists, generally in urban areas.The new law rolls back the landmark California Environmental Quality Act, waiving its regulations for “infill” projects and clearing the path for a wide range of development, including single-family homes as well as multiunit and mixed-use projects.Housing effort has community impactThe new laws will affect residents in different ways. In some areas, developments have the potential to usher in big changes to traffic patterns and demographics.Ms. Crane moved to Santa Monica with her husband in 1982. They bought a 1920s Spanish bungalow on a leafy street not far from the planned 170-unit building.If that building goes up, she says, not only will traffic increase on the smaller side streets, but it will make parking more difficult as well. She also laments the loss of businesses along the commercial stretch, which has a mix of restaurants, boutiques, grocery stores, and shuttered storefronts.“We’re losing community,” she says.But the YIMBY movement has had strong backing in the State Legislature. Standing for “Yes in My Backyard,” YIMBY counters the idea of supporting solutions as long as they’re implemented somewhere other than near where one lives.

That “yes” movement, which advocates for more and denser housing, is championed by state Sen. Scott Wiener, who was elected on a pro-housing platform. Governor Newsom campaigned on a promise to lead the state in building millions of new units by 2025. Both say increasing the housing supply will ease the state’s affordability crisis.California YIMBY declared the state’s reform package a “landmark victory” earlier this month in a newsletter. “2025 was by far the biggest year for pro-housing reforms in our history,” the group wrote.But driving around Santa Monica on a tour of the new housing complexes, Ms. Crane calls them “a gift to the developers.” (The Monitor reached out to builders and had no response.)

More than 1,000 new apartments are scheduled to be built in Santa Monica, California, a city with about 91,000 residents. One of those developments will replace this stretch of restaurants and services along Wilshire Boulevard.
“This is not going to generate affordable units,” she says. “This is driving the middle class out.”The National Association of Home Builders published a recent study that determined about 75% of U.S. families could not afford to purchase a median-priced home. For most of the last 20 years, median home prices in the U.S. have exceeded the affordability benchmark of 30% of a family’s income. This year, the median cost of housing in the U.S. shot up to nearly half (47%) of a family’s median income.Miracle McKinney aspires to purchase a home, but for now, “it’s just really survival,” she says.Ms. McKinney estimates she spends close to 70% of her monthly income on housing, even though she lives in a subsidized apartment. As a volunteer with the nonprofit Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment, she advocates for policies that keep people housed. “Building isn’t the only solution,” says an ACCE spokesperson.

2025-10-29 17:30:00,"The number of contract signings stayed flat month over month, as the National Association of Realtors’ (NAR) Pending Home Sales Index stalled at a reading of 74.8 in September.
An index reading of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001.
“Contract signings matched the second-strongest pace of the year. However, signings have yet to fully reach the level needed for a healthy market despite mortgage rates reaching a one-year low,” Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist, said in a statement. “A record-high stock market and growing housing wealth in September were not enough to offset a likely softening job market.”
In addition to remaining flat month over month, pending home sales were down 0.9% annually in September.
Despite these results, roughly 20% of NAR members surveyed expect to see an uptick in buyer traffic or seller traffic in the next three months, according to the Realtors’ Confidence Index.
Although some Realtors might be expecting a more active housing market in the current months, economists warn that affordability remains a challenge for many consumers.
“Lower rates have been bringing some buyers into the market, but according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association, the recent drop in rates has primarily increased refinance activity rather than purchase activity,” Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist for Bright MLS, said in a statement.
“Affordability is still a constraint even as rates have fallen to their lowest level in a year. And consumers are generally feeling more cautious amidst growing economic uncertainty.”
Sam Williamson, First American’s senior economist, added that he expects much of the year’s sales activity will be driven by “life happens” moments, especially as affordability challenges and structural inventory shortages continue to weigh on demand.
“Lower rates help, but they’re not a cure-all,” Williamson said in a statement.
Regionally, pending home sales rose month over month in the Northeast (65.7) and South (90.0), which recorded 3.1% and 1.1% increases, respectively.
In contrast, pending home sales fell on a monthly basis in the Midwest (down 3.4% to a reading of 73.8) and the West (down 0.2% to 59.2). Annually, pending home sales rose in the Northeast (0.5%) and South (0.9%) but fell in the Midwest (-1.5%) and West (-5.3%).
“The South led the way, posting both month-over-month and year-over-year gains. Its relative affordability — especially when paired with lower mortgage rates — continues to support buyer activity by making the payment-to-paycheck equation more manageable,” Williamson said.
“The Northeast saw a modest rebound from August, but remains essentially flat compared to last year, while the Midwest gave back some of its August strength, with declines on both a monthly and annual basis. Meanwhile, the West continues to lag, remaining the softest region for signings.”

San Francisco mayor proposes denser housing to tackle affordability crisis

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie is trying to get more homes built for people like Liam Murphy: a fifth-generation city kid who found himself repeatedly outbid for tiny two-bedroom houses that wound up selling for $1.6 million.Murphy, 39, now lives about an hour's drive away from his job as a San Francisco firefighter. He says it's too late for his family to move back, but he hopes others can stay in a city where the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom is $3,500.“That would just make for a better city overall,” said Murphy, “and the reason is because city kids just grow up being exposed to more. They're exposed to all the cultures of San Francisco, which makes a more well-rounded person.”Tiny, colorful San Francisco — just seven miles squared — embraces its image as a city that welcomes all. But its inability to build more housing has made it one of the world's toughest places to find a home, risking the diversity it prides itself on.Epithets are hurled at the mayorLurie hopes to change that, with a plan to allow for denser and taller buildings throughout much of the city, including the westside Sunset neighborhood of single-family homes and the tourist friendly Haight-Ashbury, which is studded with classic Victorian and Edwardian homes.The issue has roiled the city, and threats of recall loom over San Francisco supervisors who go along with Lurie. At a recent housing rally, the mayor who won a rare reprieve from President Donald Trump's threats to send in federal forces struggled to be heard over angry chants of “shame!” and “liar.”Protesters demanded the city invest in 100% below-market rate housing and accused him of being a gentrifier and a Republican.“I truly believe that this has San Franciscans' best interests at heart. Are some people going to be fearful? Absolutely. I get it. Change is scary,” said Lurie, who is a centrist Democrat. “But the status quo is not working. There's an affordability crisis right now.”Democrats vs DemocratsThe city's estimated 830,000 residents are passionate over both land use and equity. Housing projects have died as pressure to create more affordable units made potential developments unprofitable. Residents also want their stunning views.But San Francisco is under pressure from the state to adopt a new zoning plan allowing for 36,000 more homes by 2031 — or else the state will decide what gets built where — and the mayor likely has the votes to pass his “Family Zoning Plan.”Supporters say it's a matter of supply and demand, and that more homes will bring down the overall cost of housing.Critics say such trickle-down economics will not work in a city like San Francisco, which is in such global demand that some foreign investors buy properties sight-unseen. They say developers will only build luxury housing that's too costly for most workers, while displacing tenants and destroying the character of entire neighborhoods.“There’s a herd of elephants in the room that no one will address,” says Eric Jaye, a Democratic political consultant who opposes the plan.A city 'for people who didn’t love cities’Much of the housing push has come from Democrats, including a former city mayor, Gov. Gavin Newsom, who signed into law a proposal by San Francisco state Sen. Scott Wiener to build more homes near transit.The city has made enormous strides in recent years, with whole districts of tall condo buildings cropping up around downtown, says Rafael Mandelman, president of the Board of Supervisors. But he acknowledges that people come to San Francisco for its more intimate neighborhoods and access to green space.“San Francisco, historically, was the city for people who didn’t love cities,"" Mandelman said.Katherine Roberts, 72, initially welcomed construction of an affordable housing complex near the three-story Edwardian she labored to buy in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood two decades ago.But at 160 units and eight stories high, the massive building has shattered her peace of mind, dominating her view.“I’m looking out and it’s like I’m living in East Germany. How can you build something this inappropriate in a historic neighborhood like the Haight-Ashbury?” Roberts said. “What about all the people who already live here? What are we supposed to do?”Proposal calls for denser homesFor the most part, the new zoning plan allows for more housing to be packed into the space of a single-family home — say a duplex with a studio — without exceeding the city's height limit of roughly four stories for such properties. At least 15% of new housing must be below-market rate.Buildings on neighborhood commercial corridors could double to eight stories. Busier thoroughfares could see high-rises of 10 stories and more, and in a few spots, on Van Ness Avenue, heights could hit 650 feet (200 meters), rivaling some downtown skyscrapers.Passage of Lurie's proposal won't necessarily lead to more homes in a city with high labor and construction costs and “notoriously complex and cumbersome"" approval processes, as the state said in a scathing 2023 review.And so city dwellers make do with overcrowded — and sometimes awkward — living situations.Laura Foote, executive director of “yes in my backyard” YIMBY Action, wound up living with the man who is now her husband — and the woman he was divorcing — in a one-bedroom apartment for about six months, until his ex could find another rental.“We didn’t kill each other,” Foote said, “but it went on longer than it would have in a well-functioning housing market.”Mayor's plan is likely to passSupervisors are still negotiating amendments to the zoning plan, which could be voted out of committee on Monday for consideration by the full board. Some supervisors want to exempt historic properties, or all buildings currently used for housing. The mayor agreed to exempt buildings with at least three rent-controlled units.The compromise was a major relief for Phyllis Nabhan, 78, who lives in the Richmond neighborhood, between the Golden Gate Bridge and Golden Gate Park. She fears becoming homeless if a developer scoops up the property she's called home for 47 years, starting with a rent of just $350 a month.But Nabhan still objects to the proposal. She says it would ruin her neighborhood's “cozy and wonderful” feel, and blames the state for forcing the city to change.“I think that this mayor is trying,” she said. “It’s a horrible job, I wouldn’t want to be mayor.”

2025-10-28 14:30:00,"Mortgage rates have remained stubbornly high: hovering at more than 6%, well above the sub-3% rates during the pandemic. That makes homeownership increasingly unaffordable for many Americans, as home prices have risen more than 50% since 2020.During the pandemic, home buyers got accustomed to sub-3% mortgage rates, which made purchasing a house feel more achievable. But in the past couple of years, buyers have had no such luck.Recommended VideoIn late 2023, mortgage rates peaked at 8%. They’ve let up some, today’s 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.19%, according to Mortgage News Daily, but economists and real-estate groups have warned they don’t see that figure budging much in the near future. And to make matters worse, some have said the mortgage rate it would take to make homes feel affordable again isn’t achievable. This summer, Zillow economic analyst Anushna Prakash reported mortgage rates would need to drop to 4.43% for a typical home to be affordable to an average buyer. But “that kind of a rate decline is currently unrealistic,” Prakash wrote. Meanwhile, not even a 0% interest rate would make a typical home affordable in New York, Los Angeles, Miami, San Francisco, San Diego, or San Jose, she added. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices also said in an early July report mortgage rates are one of the main deterrents for both home buyers and sellers.“Many homeowners are reluctant [to] put their homes on the market and give up the low mortgage rates they already have,” according to Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices. “To them, high price gains won’t mitigate their ability to pay more for another home at significantly higher interest rates.”This issue is also referred to as golden handcuffs—or the locked-in mortgage rate effect. The idea is that current homeowners have no incentive to put their homes on the market, even if they want to move, because they’d forgo a much lower mortgage rate they had locked in years ago. This causes a litany of other problems in the housing market, namely inventory.The homebuilder unsold completed inventory recently hit a 16-year high, according to ResiClub, and data from real estate intelligence platform Parcl Labs shows the number of active listings on the market this summer rose to 3.06 million, a 4.9% increase from the same time last year. Meanwhile, more sellers delisting their properties after sitting on the market for longer than expected.“Homes are sitting on the market nearly three weeks longer than last year,” Realtor.com Senior Economist Jake Krimmel recently told Fortune. “That’s a sign of sellers still anchored to pandemic-era prices even though the market is telling them otherwise.” That doesn’t mean there’s an influx of housing in the U.S.; in fact, we’re still short millions of units. It just means there aren’t enough people who can actually afford to buy a home.The factors influencing housing affordabilityAlthough inventory levels are increasing, home prices and mortgage rates continue to be a roadblock for potential home buyers. Mortgage rates have remained “stubbornly high,” Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices said, deterring new buyers from the market.According to an October Realtor.com report, the typical home spent 62 days on the market in July, roughly as long as it took to sell before the pandemic.Mortgage rates are certainly a factor among buyers when deciding to make an offer, and home prices are also up more than 50% since the onset of the pandemic, according to the U.S. Case-Shiller Home Price Index.All the while, wages haven’t grown at the same pace as home appreciation, making buying a house feel even more unaffordable. And if nothing changes like mortgage rates, inventory, or wage growth, it’s likely the housing affordability crisis in the U.S. will persist, Alexandra Gupta, a real-estate broker with The Corcoran Group, told Fortune.“Some first-time buyers are turning to long-term renting or even co-living models because the idea of owning a home has become so out of reach. Others are relying more on family support to get into the market,” Gupta said. “We’re seeing a reshaping of the housing ladder.”The small glimmer of hope, though, is home price growth appears to be slowing, according to the Case-Shiller indices.“With affordability still stretched and inventory constrained, national home prices are holding steady, but barely,” Nicholas Godec, head of fixed-income tradables and commodities at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said in a statement.A version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on July 31, 2025.Fortune Brainstorm AI returns to San Francisco Dec. 8–9 to convene the smartest people we know—technologists, entrepreneurs, Fortune Global 500 executives, investors, policymakers, and the brilliant minds in between—to explore and interrogate the most pressing questions about AI at another pivotal moment.

2025-10-27 23:15:00,"Survey: Housing affordability, traffic and safety are top issues in Metro AtlantaHousing affordability, traffic and safety are top issues in Metro Atlanta, in regional survey results.By Patrick QuinnPublished: Oct. 24, 2025 at 6:53 PM EDTEmail This LinkShare on FacebookShare on X (formerly Twitter)Share on PinterestShare on LinkedInATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - Housing affordability is the top issue in metro Atlanta, followed by traffic woes and safety concerns, according to new survey results by the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC). ARC released its annual Atlanta Speaks Survey, where it polled 4,121 adults across 11 metro Atlanta counties and the City of Atlanta. “I feel like there’s a loaded question. There are so many big issues. Traffic is definitely one of them, if we’re talking about Atlanta. Housing is a huge one,” said Alexia Lewis, an Atlanta resident.Interestingly, 62% of respondents said they would not be able to afford another house or apartment in their current neighborhood. “Stop building these luxury apartments that nobody is asking for. Let’s maybe work on the property taxes,” Lewis said.“I think the rent gets higher and higher each year. There needs to be something. I live in the West End, and you can see it all around,” said John, another Atlanta resident.In 2024, the economy was named as the region’s top issue in the same survey. One of the most staggering findings from the annual survey, many people feel things are getting worse. Nearly half (46.5%) of respondents said they expected living conditions in metro Atlanta to be worse in the next 3-4 years, while 16% said they thought things would be better over that time period, according to survey results.In 2024, 33% of respondents said things would be worse off and 28% said they’d be better.The survey was released Friday as part of the State of the Region address in downtown Atlanta, hosted by Atlanta Regional Commission. Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens along with Ed Bastian, CEO of Delta Air Lines, were the featured speakers at the annual event. In the lobby of the Georgia World Congress Center sat a potential solution to address on of Atlanta’s biggest problems. Glydways, an autonomous vehicle company based in the San Francisco Bay area, showcased one of its newest vehicles. In 2026, the company is launching a two-year pilot program adjacent to Atlanta’s airport. The autonomous service will run between the SkyTrain by the Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport and the Georgia International Convention Center/Gateway Arena. “What we’re seeing in Atlanta, and this is common to a lot of major metros, is they [Atlanta] have unmet needs on mobility that are not well-served by building a new highway and can’t be well-served by building new rail because it’s so expensive, so can we help,” said Brian Gettinger, senior VP of growth for Glydways.MARTA invested $10 million to fund the project, which is set to start in 2026. The autonomous system could potentially expand into south Fulton and Clayton counties. Gettinger said they’ve also been in early discussions with Mayor Dickens and Beltline officials about expansion long the Beltline’s eastside trail or along the North Avenue corridor between Ponce City Market and Georgia Tech. “Really for us, we see our vision for transit opportunity as not just a pilot at the airport, that’s a start. But where within the Atlanta region are there needs for mobility that can’t be well-served by rail, it’s too expensive, [and] it may not be well-served by bus,” Gettinger said.Copyright 2025 WANF.

Poll: Housing industry is part of affordability problem
Tenant Juan Enciso joins a protest outside his North Hollywood apartment on Wednesday, June 19, 2019. With the help of Los Angeles Tenants Union, residents of 11815 Gilmore Street hold a rent strike at the apartment complex. Some residents are having a difficult time paying the three rent increases they have received this year in a building where residents say repairs are not being met.

What’s the biggest cause of high housing costs in the nation?

Industry insiders answer that government bureaucracy slows or prevents the construction of new housing, compounded by the public’s “not-in-my-backyard” aversion to adding homes in their neighborhoods.

Well, one poll shows the typical American thinks the industry needs to look at itself, too. The Searchlight Institute’s recent poll of 2,123 U.S. adults on housing provides another perspective on the grand affordability debate.

There’s no argument about the scope of the financial burden, as 93% of those polled said housing was overly expensive – with 43% saying “way too high.”

But one question summed up the doubts about the industry’s contention that housing construction is the best cure for affordability.

The poll asked: “Do you believe that increasing the number of homes in your community will lower prices or raise prices?”

The results showed 44% of those polled saw development as raising prices vs. 24% seeing price declines.

Some industry insiders and policy wonks will say the public needs a few economics lessons. More supply should lower prices.

But what many Americans see is construction that focuses on higher-end residences. To those eyes, that’s increasing their local housing cost.

The industry is currently burdened with huge inventories of unsold new houses and empty new apartments, which are offered at what many see as inflated prices. Perhaps those selling homes and leasing rentals should rethink customer concerns about affordability.

Consider who Americans blamed when the poll sought rankings of affordability roadblocks. Look at what drew the most votes as examples of housing policy’s disconnect.

#1 Investors

The poll found 48% of Americans surveyed cited “investors are buying up housing to turn a profit” as a big cause of high housing costs.

Numerous industry insiders argue that investors are good for the market. Their cash provides liquidity, particularly as buyers when others won’t take the risk.

Critics say investor cash inflates prices above what many house hunters can afford, essentially squeezing out first-time buyers. Tax breaks for investors give them further advantages in the marketplace.

Another poll question details Americans’ unease with “institutional” house investors – a minor but controversial slice of the market.

When asked what would happen to home prices if banks or corporations were banned from homeownership, 36% of those polled said prices would decrease, vs. 22% who thought they’d rise.

#2 Construction costs

The poll found 46% of Americans surveyed cited “materials used to build homes are too expensive.”

It’s not clear if that’s criticism or a sympathetic answer.

Elsewhere in the results, you see that when asked about barriers to affordability, 67% of those polled cited the focus of landlords and developers on high-profit projects. That’s a dig at the industry’s luxury push.

But Americans polled also agree with industry beefs about the costs builders incur.

Note that 76% of those polled saw construction costs and financing requirements as an affordability barrier, 66% acknowledged the challenges of limited land and infrastructure, and 55% saw shortages of workers and materials as a problem.

#3 Landlords

The poll found 43% of Americans surveyed cited “landlords are raising rents faster than necessary.”

Costs for tenants have skyrocketed in recent years, and it appears the industry has work to do to explain its pricing and potential solutions.

Consider the popularity of two fixes: rent control, the industry’s bane, and what developers want: easy construction of more units.

When asked about the impact of tactics to improve affordability, both rent freezes/caps and friendlier apartment zoning received approval from 34% of those polled, seeing the moves as cost-cutters.

But 26% fear rising costs from pro-apartment policies – likely tied to upscale development.

Contrast that to the 19% who saw rent control increasing expenses. Pricing limits can make costs higher for tenants who live in non-regulated units.

#4 Politicians

The poll found that 33% of Americans surveyed cited that “elected officials do not prioritize policies to make housing more affordable.”

So Americans do sympathize with the industry’s battles to increase housing supply.

Government approvals and community input for projects were seen as an affordability barrier by 61% of those polled, vs. 21% who didn’t see a concern. And zoning and regulation were a barrier to 68% of those surveyed, vs. 17% who didn’t.

By the way, a new California law would limit community opposition to mid-rise apartment construction near transit hubs.

Additionally, Americans are OK with the industry’s wishes for streamlined project approvals. Faster permitting was popular: 65% approved vs. 17% disapproved.

 Housing expert on possible solutions to Maine's affordability crisis

A worker moves a steel i-beam at the site of a construction of a housing project, Thursday, July 31, 2025, in Portland, Maine.    

There is no one solution to the housing crisis in Maine. That's the message of Doctor Chris Herbert, managing director of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing and keynote speaker at a conference of real estate professionals in Portland this week. 
Morning Edition Host Irwin Gratz spoke with Herbert, who says on top of the rising cost of building materials, there's a shortage of affordable land and stubbornly high interest rates.

This interview has been edited for clarity.
Hebert: So if you think about where we were in 2021-2022 when the Fed started to raise rates, interest rates were at 3%. Now mortgage rates are 6.3% and house prices are higher than they were in '21-'22 so they'd have to get down to 3% or 4% again to be affordable at the level they were. And I don't think we're gonna get there anytime soon.
Gratz: Maine's Legislature has taken a few steps in the last couple of years to encourage more affordable housing. Are there examples you've seen in other states that could be a model for Maine?

You know, I think the things that Maine has done — to allow for accessory dwelling units; to allow for multiple homes on smaller sites, sites that are well serviced by water and sewer; allowing for that higher density, smaller housing — they haven't had a chance to really work yet. I think that allowing that greater infill density — in a state like Maine, you're not going to get a lot of 6-, 10-, 12-story buildings. What you're going to have to do is infill in that lower-density area you have. So I would give the things that Maine has done time to work.
Could innovations like modular home construction or even 3D printing be a part of the solution?
Yes, but I think so far, we found that there are limits to how far that will go. Part of it has to do with the scale the factories can get to. In order to have low cost, you have to have, like, Ford Model Ts rolling off the assembly line at the rates of thousands. And housing doesn't get built at that scale. I will say one of the solutions is sitting right in front of us, and that has achieved that scale, is the good old HUD-manufactured home. That factory-built housing is actually much more cost effective than stick-built, site-built housing. In a place like Maine, it could really fit in well. It has a stigma. People think of it as a trailer and as a mobile home. The new manufactured home, you couldn't tell the difference between it and a ranch home, and it really is more affordable to build.
Yeah but the other problem we've run into there, and the Legislature is trying to address this as well, is that suddenly the land that people lease for these are going way up.
I do know that Maine has passed some laws around right of first refusal. Massachusetts has had those laws, and they've worked really well. But I think if what you really want to do is give people an opportunity to build wealth, thinking about getting them on their own land is also still an important avenue.
Do we need people to be thinking differently if we're going to get at the housing crisis?
We do, and I think a lot of times the arguments about changes in housing are talking about units, and they're talking about affordable units, and they're not talking about people. Oftentimes, when we do think about those people, we tend to make them the ""other."" But I'll tell you, I live in a wealthy suburb in the Boston area where housing prices have gone through the roof, probably not unlike a lot of areas around Portland. And I think one of the things that's getting people open to the idea of broader range of housing is the fact that when I get to retirement and I want to stay in that community, I can't afford it. The taxes have gone through the roof. My friends are there, my church is there, my doctor is there. And so where do I go? The other thing that happens is your kids. So you want your kids to come back to town and they don't have a place to live. The housing market right now is not working for anyone, for the most part. And so I think, you know, we have to think about, how do we make room for our community, our family, our friends, to have a place to live here? And that's — personalizing and humanizing the story, I think, is important.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie is trying to get more homes built for people like Liam Murphy: a fifth-generation city kid who found himself repeatedly outbid for tiny two-bedroom houses that wound up selling for $1.6 million.
Murphy, 39, now lives about an hour’s drive away from his job as a San Francisco firefighter. He says it’s too late for his family to move back, but he hopes others can stay in a city where the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom is $3,500.
“That would just make for a better city overall,” said Murphy, “and the reason is because city kids just grow up being exposed to more. They’re exposed to all the cultures of San Francisco, which makes a more well-rounded person.”
Tiny, colorful San Francisco — just seven miles squared — embraces its image as a city that welcomes all. But its inability to build more housing has made it one of the world’s toughest places to find a home, risking the diversity it prides itself on.
Epithets are hurled at the mayor
Lurie hopes to change that, with a plan to allow for denser and taller buildings throughout much of the city, including the westside Sunset neighborhood of single-family homes and the tourist friendly Haight-Ashbury, which is studded with classic Victorian and Edwardian homes.
The issue has roiled the city, and threats of recall loom over San Francisco supervisors who go along with Lurie. At a recent housing rally, the mayor who won a rare reprieve from President Donald Trump’s threats to send in federal forces struggled to be heard over angry chants of “shame!” and “liar.”
Protesters demanded the city invest in 100% below-market rate housing and accused him of being a gentrifier and a Republican.
“I truly believe that this has San Franciscans’ best interests at heart. Are some people going to be fearful? Absolutely. I get it. Change is scary,” said Lurie, who is a centrist Democrat. “But the status quo is not working. There’s an affordability crisis right now.”
Democrats vs Democrats
The city’s estimated 830,000 residents are passionate over both land use and equity. Housing projects have died as pressure to create more affordable units made potential developments unprofitable. Residents also want their stunning views.
But San Francisco is under pressure from the state to adopt a new zoning plan allowing for 36,000 more homes by 2031 — or else the state will decide what gets built where — and the mayor likely has the votes to pass his “Family Zoning Plan.”
Supporters say it’s a matter of supply and demand, and that more homes will bring down the overall cost of housing.
Critics say such trickle-down economics will not work in a city like San Francisco, which is in such global demand that some foreign investors buy properties sight-unseen. They say developers will only build luxury housing that’s too costly for most workers, while displacing tenants and destroying the character of entire neighborhoods.
“There’s a herd of elephants in the room that no one will address,” says Eric Jaye, a Democratic political consultant who opposes the plan.
A city ‘for people who didn’t love cities’
Much of the housing push has come from Democrats, including a former city mayor, Gov. Gavin Newsom, who signed into law a proposal by San Francisco state Sen. Scott Wiener to build more homes near transit.
The city has made enormous strides in recent years, with whole districts of tall condo buildings cropping up around downtown, says Rafael Mandelman, president of the Board of Supervisors. But he acknowledges that people come to San Francisco for its more intimate neighborhoods and access to green space.
“San Francisco, historically, was the city for people who didn’t love cities,” Mandelman said.
Katherine Roberts, 72, initially welcomed construction of an affordable housing complex near the three-story Edwardian she labored to buy in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood two decades ago.
But at 160 units and eight stories high, the massive building has shattered her peace of mind, dominating her view.
“I’m looking out and it’s like I’m living in East Germany. How can you build something this inappropriate in a historic neighborhood like the Haight-Ashbury?” Roberts said. “What about all the people who already live here? What are we supposed to do?”
Proposal calls for denser homes
For the most part, the new zoning plan allows for more housing to be packed into the space of a single-family home — say a duplex with a studio — without exceeding the city’s height limit of roughly four stories for such properties. At least 15% of new housing must be below-market rate.
Buildings on neighborhood commercial corridors could double to eight stories. Busier thoroughfares could see high-rises of 10 stories and more, and in a few spots, on Van Ness Avenue, heights could hit 650 feet (200 meters), rivaling some downtown skyscrapers.
Passage of Lurie’s proposal won’t necessarily lead to more homes in a city with high labor and construction costs and “notoriously complex and cumbersome” approval processes, as the state said in a scathing 2023 review.
And so city dwellers make do with overcrowded — and sometimes awkward — living situations.
Laura Foote, executive director of “yes in my backyard” YIMBY Action, wound up living with the man who is now her husband — and the woman he was divorcing — in a one-bedroom apartment for about six months, until his ex could find another rental.
“We didn’t kill each other,” Foote said, “but it went on longer than it would have in a well-functioning housing market.”
Mayor’s plan is likely to pass
Supervisors are still negotiating amendments to the zoning plan, which could be voted out of committee on Monday for consideration by the full board. Some supervisors want to exempt historic properties, or all buildings currently used for housing. The mayor agreed to exempt buildings with at least three rent-controlled units.
The compromise was a major relief for Phyllis Nabhan, 78, who lives in the Richmond neighborhood, between the Golden Gate Bridge and Golden Gate Park. She fears becoming homeless if a developer scoops up the property she’s called home for 47 years, starting with a rent of just $350 a month.
But Nabhan still objects to the proposal. She says it would ruin her neighborhood’s “cozy and wonderful” feel, and blames the state for forcing the city to change.
“I think that this mayor is trying,” she said. “It’s a horrible job, I wouldn’t want to be mayor.”

Loveland panel charts path forward on housing affordability
At a League of Women Voters forum, housing leaders cited rising construction costs, limited supply and community resistance, while praising city efforts to spur affordable optionsShare this:

By Jocelyn Rowley | jrowley@prairiemountainmedia.com | Loveland Reporter-HeraldPUBLISHED: October 24, 2025 at 10:20 AM MDT Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...There might not be easy answers to Loveland’s affordable housing crisis, but that doesn’t mean there are no answers.
On Thursday, about 40 people gathered at the Mirasol Event Center to learn more about the challenges in the local housing market with three of the people working hardest to overcome them:  Jeff Feneis, executive director of the Loveland Housing Authority; Jammie Sabin, co-owner of Aspen Homes of Colorado; and Alison Hade, the city’s community partnership administrator.
The two-hour event was co-hosted by the League of Women Voters and the city’s Affordable Housing Task Force. It began with the basics — what constitutes affordable housing and why there is a lack of it in Northern Colorado.
According to Julie Stackhouse, a LWV member and  a retired executive vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, “affordable housing” often means different things to different people, but there are some official parameters for it set by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Per HUD, a household’s housing is considered affordable when it costs less than 30% of gross income. For a household earning $5,000 a month, that translates to no more than $1,500 in rent or mortgage payments, plus utilities.
But housing priced at that point is very hard to find in the Fort Collins-Loveland area these days due to population growth over the last several years that has outstripped the supply of available units. As a result, Stackhouse told the audience, the median sales price of a single-family home has quadrupled since 1995 to $580,000.
Continuing, Stackhouse said that escalating input costs for construction are also driving high housing prices, mostly thanks to the high cost of water.
“Water is a big deal here, and not just because water is scarce and expensive,” she said. “It’s because, depending on which water company you’re working with, you’re going to have a different set of criteria to abide by.”
After the table was set with the data, the three panelists took turns answering questions about what the city is doing right to alleviate the housing crisis and what remains to be done.
To the first question, both Feneis and Sabin praised the city’s efforts to be an active partner in finding solutions through the task force, which was formed in 2021 and tasked with expanding housing options for working families.
Both also said that close collaboration between developers, builders and the city had been the key to several affordable projects in Loveland, such as Legacy Crossing, a 60-acre neighborhood near Taft Avenue and 57th Street being developed by the Housing Authority in partnership with three homebuilders. When completed, it will include roughly 330 homes serving families from 40 percent to 120 percent of the area median income.
“I do feel very fortunate that we’re in Loveland in the support that the affordable housing community has received is tremendous,” said Feneis. “And I’m optimistic a lot of the work that’s been happening the last three, four years through the task force, which couldn’t happen without the city’s involvement, is starting to come to fruition.”
Hade outlined several recent policy changes designed to reduce costs, including fee waivers for affordable units and a “scalable” fee model that adjusts water and utility fees based on home size. Beginning in January, Loveland will become the first city in Colorado to adopt that model. Smaller homes will also pay proportionally lower capital-expansion fees, which fund parks, police and other infrastructure.
“These policies took a lot of time and hard work to develop,” Hade said. “It’s been a lot of really good work and a great collaboration with city departments.”
Still, the city faces obstacles, notably an out-of-date comprehensive plan that complicates approval of mixed-density or nontraditional housing developments, according to Hade.
“The comprehensive plan should be updated every 10 years,” Hade said. “It’s overdue, and we don’t have the money to do it. That’s an obstacle to producing the kind of housing people want.”
Another, panelists agreed, is community resistance.
“Everyone wants affordable housing in Loveland,” Sabin said, “but a lot of people don’t want it next to them. We have a large NIMBY contingent that is vocal and organized.”
He urged residents who support new housing to counterbalance that opposition by speaking up at public hearings.
“Your voice matters,” he said. “You don’t have to be an expert — just show up and say this is the kind of project we need.”
Audience questions touched on the role of metro districts, manufactured housing and accessory dwelling units (ADUs), as well as Proposition 123, a state program requiring participating cities to increase affordable housing stock by 3 percent per year to qualify for construction funding.
While none of the speakers claimed there was a silver bullet, all three emphasized that Loveland is moving in the right direction, even if the journey will be a long one.
“From my perspective, the Affordable Housing Task Force and the city staff have been working for the last several years, and the impact of that is just about to get to the market next year and the year after and then you’ll start seeing some real changes,” Sabin said.

Tenant Juan Enciso joins a protest outside his North Hollywood apartment on Wednesday, June 19, 2019. With the help of Los Angeles Tenants Union, residents of 11815 Gilmore Street hold a rent strike at the apartment complex. Some residents are having a difficult time paying the three rent increases they have received this year in a building where residents say repairs are not being met.

By Jonathan Lansner | jlansner@scng.com | Orange County RegisterPUBLISHED: October 23, 2025 at 7:24 AM PDT | UPDATED: October 24, 2025 at 5:54 PM PDTGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...What’s the biggest cause of high housing costs in the nation?
Industry insiders answer that government bureaucracy slows or prevents the construction of new housing, compounded by the public’s “not-in-my-backyard” aversion to adding homes in their neighborhoods.
Well, one poll shows the typical American thinks the industry needs to look at itself, too. The Searchlight Institute’s recent poll of 2,123 U.S. adults on housing provides another perspective on the grand affordability debate.
Also see: Southern California home sales slump to another record low
There’s no argument about the scope of the financial burden, as 93% of those polled said housing was overly expensive – with 43% saying “way too high.”
But one question summed up the doubts about the industry’s contention that housing construction is the best cure for affordability.
The poll asked: “Do you believe that increasing the number of homes in your community will lower prices or raise prices?”
The results showed 44% of those polled saw development as raising prices vs. 24% seeing price declines.
Some industry insiders and policy wonks will say the public needs a few economics lessons. More supply should lower prices.
But what many Americans see is construction that focuses on higher-end residences. To those eyes, that’s increasing their local housing cost.
The industry is currently burdened with huge inventories of unsold new houses and empty new apartments, which are offered at what many see as inflated prices. Perhaps those selling homes and leasing rentals should rethink customer concerns about affordability.
Consider who Americans blamed when the poll sought rankings of affordability roadblocks. Look at what drew the most votes as examples of housing policy’s disconnect.
#1 Investors
The poll found 48% of Americans surveyed cited “investors are buying up housing to turn a profit” as a big cause of high housing costs.
Numerous industry insiders argue that investors are good for the market. Their cash provides liquidity, particularly as buyers when others won’t take the risk.
Critics say investor cash inflates prices above what many house hunters can afford, essentially squeezing out first-time buyers. Tax breaks for investors give them further advantages in the marketplace.
Another poll question details Americans’ unease with “institutional” house investors – a minor but controversial slice of the market.
When asked what would happen to home prices if banks or corporations were banned from homeownership, 36% of those polled said prices would decrease, vs. 22% who thought they’d rise.
#2 Construction costs
The poll found 46% of Americans surveyed cited “materials used to build homes are too expensive.”
It’s not clear if that’s criticism or a sympathetic answer.
Elsewhere in the results, you see that when asked about barriers to affordability, 67% of those polled cited the focus of landlords and developers on high-profit projects. That’s a dig at the industry’s luxury push.
But Americans polled also agree with industry beefs about the costs builders incur.
Note that 76% of those polled saw construction costs and financing requirements as an affordability barrier, 66% acknowledged the challenges of limited land and infrastructure, and 55% saw shortages of workers and materials as a problem.
#3 Landlords
The poll found 43% of Americans surveyed cited “landlords are raising rents faster than necessary.”
Costs for tenants have skyrocketed in recent years, and it appears the industry has work to do to explain its pricing and potential solutions.
Consider the popularity of two fixes: rent control, the industry’s bane, and what developers want: easy construction of more units.
When asked about the impact of tactics to improve affordability, both rent freezes/caps and friendlier apartment zoning received approval from 34% of those polled, seeing the moves as cost-cutters.
But 26% fear rising costs from pro-apartment policies – likely tied to upscale development.
Contrast that to the 19% who saw rent control increasing expenses. Pricing limits can make costs higher for tenants who live in non-regulated units.
#4 Politicians
The poll found that 33% of Americans surveyed cited that “elected officials do not prioritize policies to make housing more affordable.”
So Americans do sympathize with the industry’s battles to increase housing supply.
Government approvals and community input for projects were seen as an affordability barrier by 61% of those polled, vs. 21% who didn’t see a concern. And zoning and regulation were a barrier to 68% of those surveyed, vs. 17% who didn’t.
By the way, a new California law would limit community opposition to mid-rise apartment construction near transit hubs.
Additionally, Americans are OK with the industry’s wishes for streamlined project approvals. Faster permitting was popular: 65% approved vs. 17% disapproved.

So Americans do sympathize with the industry’s battles to increase housing supply.
Government approvals and community input for projects were seen as an affordability barrier by 61% of those polled, vs. 21% who didn’t see a concern. And zoning and regulation were a barrier to 68% of those surveyed, vs. 17% who didn’t.
By the way, a new California law would limit community opposition to mid-rise apartment construction near transit hubs.
Additionally, Americans are OK with the industry’s wishes for streamlined project approvals. Faster permitting was popular: 65% approved vs. 17% disapproved.

Tenant Juan Enciso joins a protest outside his North Hollywood apartment on Wednesday, June 19, 2019. With the help of Los Angeles Tenants Union, residents of 11815 Gilmore Street hold a rent strike at the apartment complex. Some residents are having a difficult time paying the three rent increases they have received this year in a building where residents say repairs are not being met.

By Jon Lansner | jlansner@scng.com | Orange County RegisterPUBLISHED: October 24, 2025 at 5:59 AM PDT | UPDATED: October 24, 2025 at 6:00 AM PDTGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...What’s the biggest cause of high housing costs in the nation?
Industry insiders answer that government bureaucracy slows or prevents the construction of new housing, compounded by the public’s “not-in-my-backyard” aversion to adding homes in their neighborhoods.
Well, one poll shows the typical American thinks the industry needs to look at itself, too. The Searchlight Institute’s recent poll of 2,123 U.S. adults on housing provides another perspective on the grand affordability debate.
There’s no argument about the scope of the financial burden, as 93% of those polled said housing was overly expensive – with 43% saying “way too high.”
But one question summed up the doubts about the industry’s contention that housing construction is the best cure for affordability.
The poll asked: “Do you believe that increasing the number of homes in your community will lower prices or raise prices?”
The results showed 44% of those polled saw development as raising prices vs. 24% seeing price declines.
Some industry insiders and policy wonks will say the public needs a few economics lessons. More supply should lower prices.
But what many Americans see is construction that focuses on higher-end residences. To those eyes, that’s increasing their local housing cost.
The industry is currently burdened with huge inventories of unsold new houses and empty new apartments, which are offered at what many see as inflated prices. Perhaps those selling homes and leasing rentals should rethink customer concerns about affordability.
Consider who Americans blamed when the poll sought rankings of affordability roadblocks. Look at what drew the most votes as examples of housing policy’s disconnect.
#1 Investors
The poll found 48% of Americans surveyed cited “investors are buying up housing to turn a profit” as a big cause of high housing costs.
Numerous industry insiders argue that investors are good for the market. Their cash provides liquidity, particularly as buyers when others won’t take the risk.
Critics say investor cash inflates prices above what many house hunters can afford, essentially squeezing out first-time buyers. Tax breaks for investors give them further advantages in the marketplace.
Another poll question details Americans’ unease with “institutional” house investors – a minor but controversial slice of the market.
When asked what would happen to home prices if banks or corporations were banned from homeownership, 36% of those polled said prices would decrease, vs. 22% who thought they’d rise.
#2 Construction costs
The poll found 46% of Americans surveyed cited “materials used to build homes are too expensive.”
It’s not clear if that’s criticism or a sympathetic answer.
Elsewhere in the results, you see that when asked about barriers to affordability, 67% of those polled cited the focus of landlords and developers on high-profit projects. That’s a dig at the industry’s luxury push.
But Americans polled also agree with industry beefs about the costs builders incur.
Note that 76% of those polled saw construction costs and financing requirements as an affordability barrier, 66% acknowledged the challenges of limited land and infrastructure, and 55% saw shortages of workers and materials as a problem.
#3 Landlords
The poll found 43% of Americans surveyed cited “landlords are raising rents faster than necessary.”
Costs for tenants have skyrocketed in recent years, and it appears the industry has work to do to explain its pricing and potential solutions.
Consider the popularity of two fixes: rent control, the industry’s bane, and what developers want: easy construction of more units.
When asked about the impact of tactics to improve affordability, both rent freezes/caps and friendlier apartment zoning received approval from 34% of those polled, seeing the moves as cost-cutters.
But 26% fear rising costs from pro-apartment policies – likely tied to upscale development.
Contrast that to the 19% who saw rent control increasing expenses. Pricing limits can make costs higher for tenants who live in non-regulated units.

The Near West Side of Chicago, May 27, 2025. (Brian Cassella/Chicago Tribune)
By The Editorial Board | Chicago TribunePUBLISHED: October 27, 2025 at 5:00 AM CDT Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...Chicago long has dangled the big-city experience without the New York or San Francisco price tag. That advantage is slipping away.
A new report from Zillow shows that rents are growing faster in Chicago than any other major metro.
Sure, our population isn’t booming, but that doesn’t mean demand isn’t high. Demonstrably, construction isn’t keeping up. The Chicago metro area is building fewer new residential units than other major metros.
In many other cities, construction has caught up with demand, meaning renters are getting a break on rent affordability. But that’s not the case in the Chicago area, where rents shot up 6% over the past year, according to Zillow data. Rents in some suburbs rose over 10%. Meanwhile, rents in Austin fell 3.3% — the largest drop among major cities — followed by declines of 2.1% in Denver and 1.1% in San Antonio.
A typical rental in Chicago now costs an eye-popping $2,213 a month, up roughly $138 from a year ago and up more than $680 from a decade ago. Zillow also found you need to earn about $88,500 to comfortably afford typical rent here.
Why? As with anything, a lot goes into this phenomenon, and Chicago remains a popular landing spot for recent college grads and other professionals.
But the stark reality at play is that it’s hard to build here, and we’re not doing enough of it. Supply and demand have taken care of the rest in the form of higher rents (which are also being driven up as property owners have to cover their ever-growing property tax bills).
To be sure, rent is still much less affordable in large metro areas such as New York, where housing costs take up 41% of household budgets compared with 27% in Chicago.
We won’t lose our reputation as a livable metro overnight. But that doesn’t mean we should disregard the trends. Potential new residents won’t.
“While Chicago has traditionally drawn many graduates from nearby universities, especially in the Big Ten, that’s not guaranteed to continue if these trends persist, especially now that remote work gives more people flexibility to live anywhere,” wrote Orphe Divounguy, senior economist at Zillow.
The bottom line? Chicago needs to build.
In 2024, Chicago-area municipalities issued just 4.6 housing permits per 1,000 existing homes — less than half the national rate of 10.1 and the lowest among major U.S. metros, according to Construction Coverage, an analytics service for builders and realtors. Divounguy noted that builders have been able to better keep up with demand — and keep affordability from deteriorating — in metro areas with fewer building regulations and less-stringent zoning rules.
Just look out West. Housing costs have been going up in Denver for years, with many priced out of this competitive market. Yet while rent is climbing higher in Chicago, it’s actually going down in Denver. It’s also worth noting that developers built about 20,000 new apartments in the Denver metro area last year, according to the Denver Post.
Turns out building lots of new apartments brings down rents.
We’d like to have that problem in Chicago.

Newswise — Is America currently in a housing crisis? Wake Forest University's Sherri Lawson Clark says individuals at all economic levels—from homeless populations to middle-income homeowners are struggling with affordability.A contributor to the 2020 national report Displaced in America, Clark’s research examines the intersections of housing policy with health and welfare policies. She is developing a new housing stability measure for use throughout the U.S. in addressing housing affordability and access.Is America facing a housing crisis?Yes. As a cultural anthropologist, I am interested in the ways in which the housing crisis is experienced at the individual level. A homeless person is experiencing a housing crisis as is the middle-income homeowner whose housing costs have risen above their income. Right now, the question is not necessarily are we in a housing crisis, but are we in a place where we are likely to see the next Great Recession. I think we’re at a place where we need to pay attention.How does this moment compare to the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis that led to the Great Recession?In similar ways, the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis did not begin in 2007; it began in the mid-1990s – taking almost a decade before the financial crisis of 2008. Today, many Americans find themselves unable to afford housing. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the average homeowner or renter should spend no more than 30% of their monthly income on housing. My research shows that individuals are spending up to half of their monthly income on housing costs. This means there is little left over in their budgets for other necessities. According to the National Housing Conference, a non-profit organization dedicated to affordable housing, two issues define America’s new housing crisis: 1) skyrocketing housing costs and 2) the low rate of black homeownership, which is lower today than it was when segregation was legal.What does your research show?My current research study will shed light on the decision-making processes of homeowners and examine housing accessibility in one of East Winston-Salem, North Carolina’s high-poverty census tracts. I expect the findings will greatly aid in a newly created Housing Stability measure for use throughout the U.S. (and beyond) in addressing housing affordability and access.How do housing affordability challenges differ between urban centers, suburbs and rural areas?Available housing differs across urban areas with multi-family housing, suburban areas with single-family homes, and rural areas with more manufactured housing and single-family housing. However, all these areas face housing affordability concerns, which are projected to get worse with the current changes happening at the federal level.Who’s most at risk and what can be done?The most vulnerable across all areas are being displaced. Now is the time to think outside the box to develop alternatives to the traditional housing models. For example, limited equity cooperatives provide long-term affordability to residents who own shares in a development. Reducing zoning restrictions allows for more multi-family and smaller homes to be built on land zoned for single-family homes.Biography :Sherri Lawson Clark is an associate professor in the Department of Anthropology at Wake Forest University, where she has taught since 2009. An applied cultural anthropologist, she has conducted ethnographic fieldwork for more than 30 years with low-income urban and rural African American, Latino and white families across the U.S. Clark’s research focuses on housing instability among poor families and examines the intersections of housing policy with health and welfare policies, marriage initiatives, migration, and the effects of residential mobility on the well-being of poor children and families. At Wake Forest, Clark teaches courses in cultural anthropology and social stratification in America and helps students deconstruct and comprehend conceptual arguments by applying them in real life contexts.She is co-author of “Poverty Law and Advocacy in America” and a contributing editor to “Contemporary African American Families: Achievements, Challenges, and Empowerment Strategies in the Twenty-First Century.”### About Wake Forest UniversityWake Forest University’s motto, Pro Humanitate, reflects a commitment to academic excellence and to using ideas, knowledge and talents on behalf of humanity.

Tenant Juan Enciso joins a protest outside his North Hollywood apartment on Wednesday, June 19, 2019. With the help of Los Angeles Tenants Union, residents of 11815 Gilmore Street hold a rent strike at the apartment complex. Some residents are having a difficult time paying the three rent increases they have received this year in a building where residents say repairs are not being met.

By Jonathan Lansner | jlansner@scng.com | Orange County RegisterPUBLISHED: October 23, 2025 at 7:24 AM PDT | UPDATED: October 24, 2025 at 5:54 PM PDTGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...What’s the biggest cause of high housing costs in the nation?
Industry insiders answer that government bureaucracy slows or prevents the construction of new housing, compounded by the public’s “not-in-my-backyard” aversion to adding homes in their neighborhoods.
Well, one poll shows the typical American thinks the industry needs to look at itself, too. The Searchlight Institute’s recent poll of 2,123 U.S. adults on housing provides another perspective on the grand affordability debate.
Also see: Southern California home sales slump to another record low
There’s no argument about the scope of the financial burden, as 93% of those polled said housing was overly expensive – with 43% saying “way too high.”
But one question summed up the doubts about the industry’s contention that housing construction is the best cure for affordability.
The poll asked: “Do you believe that increasing the number of homes in your community will lower prices or raise prices?”
The results showed 44% of those polled saw development as raising prices vs. 24% seeing price declines.
Some industry insiders and policy wonks will say the public needs a few economics lessons. More supply should lower prices.
But what many Americans see is construction that focuses on higher-end residences. To those eyes, that’s increasing their local housing cost.
The industry is currently burdened with huge inventories of unsold new houses and empty new apartments, which are offered at what many see as inflated prices. Perhaps those selling homes and leasing rentals should rethink customer concerns about affordability.
Consider who Americans blamed when the poll sought rankings of affordability roadblocks. Look at what drew the most votes as examples of housing policy’s disconnect.
#1 Investors
The poll found 48% of Americans surveyed cited “investors are buying up housing to turn a profit” as a big cause of high housing costs.
Numerous industry insiders argue that investors are good for the market. Their cash provides liquidity, particularly as buyers when others won’t take the risk.
Critics say investor cash inflates prices above what many house hunters can afford, essentially squeezing out first-time buyers. Tax breaks for investors give them further advantages in the marketplace.
Another poll question details Americans’ unease with “institutional” house investors – a minor but controversial slice of the market.
When asked what would happen to home prices if banks or corporations were banned from homeownership, 36% of those polled said prices would decrease, vs. 22% who thought they’d rise.
#2 Construction costs
The poll found 46% of Americans surveyed cited “materials used to build homes are too expensive.”
It’s not clear if that’s criticism or a sympathetic answer.
Elsewhere in the results, you see that when asked about barriers to affordability, 67% of those polled cited the focus of landlords and developers on high-profit projects. That’s a dig at the industry’s luxury push.
But Americans polled also agree with industry beefs about the costs builders incur.
Note that 76% of those polled saw construction costs and financing requirements as an affordability barrier, 66% acknowledged the challenges of limited land and infrastructure, and 55% saw shortages of workers and materials as a problem.
#3 Landlords
The poll found 43% of Americans surveyed cited “landlords are raising rents faster than necessary.”
Costs for tenants have skyrocketed in recent years, and it appears the industry has work to do to explain its pricing and potential solutions.
Consider the popularity of two fixes: rent control, the industry’s bane, and what developers want: easy construction of more units.
When asked about the impact of tactics to improve affordability, both rent freezes/caps and friendlier apartment zoning received approval from 34% of those polled, seeing the moves as cost-cutters.
But 26% fear rising costs from pro-apartment policies – likely tied to upscale development.
Contrast that to the 19% who saw rent control increasing expenses. Pricing limits can make costs higher for tenants who live in non-regulated units.
#4 Politicians
The poll found that 33% of Americans surveyed cited that “elected officials do not prioritize policies to make housing more affordable.”
So Americans do sympathize with the industry’s battles to increase housing supply.
Government approvals and community input for projects were seen as an affordability barrier by 61% of those polled, vs. 21% who didn’t see a concern. And zoning and regulation were a barrier to 68% of those surveyed, vs. 17% who didn’t.
By the way, a new California law would limit community opposition to mid-rise apartment construction near transit hubs.
Additionally, Americans are OK with the industry’s wishes for streamlined project approvals. Faster permitting was popular: 65% approved vs. 17% disapproved.

Costs for tenants have skyrocketed in recent years, and it appears the industry has work to do to explain its pricing and potential solutions.
Consider the popularity of two fixes: rent control, the industry’s bane, and what developers want: easy construction of more units.
When asked about the impact of tactics to improve affordability, both rent freezes/caps and friendlier apartment zoning received approval from 34% of those polled, seeing the moves as cost-cutters.
But 26% fear rising costs from pro-apartment policies – likely tied to upscale development.
Contrast that to the 19% who saw rent control increasing expenses. Pricing limits can make costs higher for tenants who live in non-regulated units.
#4 Politicians
The poll found that 33% of Americans surveyed cited that “elected officials do not prioritize policies to make housing more affordable.”
So Americans do sympathize with the industry’s battles to increase housing supply.
Government approvals and community input for projects were seen as an affordability barrier by 61% of those polled, vs. 21% who didn’t see a concern. And zoning and regulation were a barrier to 68% of those surveyed, vs. 17% who didn’t.
By the way, a new California law would limit community opposition to mid-rise apartment construction near transit hubs.

Tenant Juan Enciso joins a protest outside his North Hollywood apartment on Wednesday, June 19, 2019. With the help of Los Angeles Tenants Union, residents of 11815 Gilmore Street hold a rent strike at the apartment complex. Some residents are having a difficult time paying the three rent increases they have received this year in a building where residents say repairs are not being met.

By Jonathan Lansner | jlansner@scng.com | Orange County RegisterPUBLISHED: October 23, 2025 at 7:24 AM PDT | UPDATED: October 24, 2025 at 5:54 PM PDTGetting your Trinity Audio player ready...What’s the biggest cause of high housing costs in the nation?
Industry insiders answer that government bureaucracy slows or prevents the construction of new housing, compounded by the public’s “not-in-my-backyard” aversion to adding homes in their neighborhoods.
Well, one poll shows the typical American thinks the industry needs to look at itself, too. The Searchlight Institute’s recent poll of 2,123 U.S. adults on housing provides another perspective on the grand affordability debate.
Also see: Southern California home sales slump to another record low
There’s no argument about the scope of the financial burden, as 93% of those polled said housing was overly expensive – with 43% saying “way too high.”
But one question summed up the doubts about the industry’s contention that housing construction is the best cure for affordability.
The poll asked: “Do you believe that increasing the number of homes in your community will lower prices or raise prices?”
The results showed 44% of those polled saw development as raising prices vs. 24% seeing price declines.
Some industry insiders and policy wonks will say the public needs a few economics lessons. More supply should lower prices.
But what many Americans see is construction that focuses on higher-end residences. To those eyes, that’s increasing their local housing cost.
The industry is currently burdened with huge inventories of unsold new houses and empty new apartments, which are offered at what many see as inflated prices. Perhaps those selling homes and leasing rentals should rethink customer concerns about affordability.
Consider who Americans blamed when the poll sought rankings of affordability roadblocks. Look at what drew the most votes as examples of housing policy’s disconnect.
#1 Investors
The poll found 48% of Americans surveyed cited “investors are buying up housing to turn a profit” as a big cause of high housing costs.
Numerous industry insiders argue that investors are good for the market. Their cash provides liquidity, particularly as buyers when others won’t take the risk.
Critics say investor cash inflates prices above what many house hunters can afford, essentially squeezing out first-time buyers. Tax breaks for investors give them further advantages in the marketplace.
Another poll question details Americans’ unease with “institutional” house investors – a minor but controversial slice of the market.
When asked what would happen to home prices if banks or corporations were banned from homeownership, 36% of those polled said prices would decrease, vs. 22% who thought they’d rise.
#2 Construction costs
The poll found 46% of Americans surveyed cited “materials used to build homes are too expensive.”
It’s not clear if that’s criticism or a sympathetic answer.
Elsewhere in the results, you see that when asked about barriers to affordability, 67% of those polled cited the focus of landlords and developers on high-profit projects. That’s a dig at the industry’s luxury push.
But Americans polled also agree with industry beefs about the costs builders incur.
Note that 76% of those polled saw construction costs and financing requirements as an affordability barrier, 66% acknowledged the challenges of limited land and infrastructure, and 55% saw shortages of workers and materials as a problem.
#3 Landlords

Former alder Juliana Bennett runs for Madison state assembly district championing housing affordability 
Bennett spoke with The Daily Cardinal about her background, inspirations for running for the 76th state assembly district and priorities for the future. 

 By Emma Kelly 
  
 October 20, 2025 | 7:58pm CDT    

Former City of Madison District 2 and 8 Alder and democratic socialist Juliana Bennett announced her campaign on a platform of affordable housing and increasing the minimum wage for the 76th state assembly district, which covers much of Madison’s downtown and isthmus, Sept. 30.  
Bennett aims to fill the deep blue seat left open by Rep. Francesca Hong’s run for governor. Her platform advocates for affordable housing, a $23 minimum wage by 2030, no-cost child and health care and full funding for the Wisconsin public schooling system.  

Bennett served on the Madison Common Council for two terms from April 2021 to April 2025.  
She joins an open Democratic primary where the party has had an unbroken hold on the 76th assembly district seat since 2013. She’s competing against a current Common Council member vying for the seat— Dina Nina Martinez-Rutherford. 
While her political experience has shaped her understanding of government, Bennett’s personal experiences have played an equally significant role in motivating her to serve. Bennett’s advocacy for cheaper medical care started with medical debt her family experienced as she finished her degree in 2022 from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  
Her father had fallen into cardiac arrest with a 6% chance of survival, it was made clear that it would take a miracle for Bennett's father to pull through. Thankfully, through the tireless efforts of medical staff, he did. However, while her father may have won a large battle with his health, there existed another battle entirely: the medical bill.  
With the costs totaling some $500,000 and an eviction looming on the horizon, Bennett saw firsthand the significant impact the state’s laws had on the well-being of its people.  
The experience not only motivated her to become an alder twice and pass local ordinances that aligned with her goals in Madison, but also inspired her to announce her current campaign for state assembly, where Bennett could extend her influence throughout Wisconsin. 

“I really saw the personal impact of how our state laws are really prohibitive on the general public, and there's only so much you can do as an alder when the state has hamstrung every single thing that we could do to help people,” Bennett told The Daily Cardinal. 
Bennett said students could be one of the  largest populations to benefit from her policies, as she aims to improve the financial and housing prospects of being a college student in Wisconsin, especially at UW-Madison. 
Fully funding the Wisconsin public education system ultimately depends on how dollars are earned and allocated within the state assembly. To increase earnings, Bennett  believes in revisiting previous avenues, such as taxing income rather than just property taxes. Other areas of investment, such as spending on incarceration, could also be significantly reduced to reinvest in public schools. 
Bennett is also in support of the Wisconsin Tuition Promise, a ‘last dollar’ tuition program the University of Wisconsin System instituted in 2023, paused and reinstituted in 2025 that covers any remaining costs of attendance for those whose families earn under the median Wisconsin income.

In the interest of covering remaining fees following students' financial aid, Bennett said the ‘last dollar’ program would minimize students’ need to take out loans they cannot afford, while encouraging Wisconsin resident enrollment in higher education. 
Bennett also acknowledged the current housing crisis UW-Madison students experience.  
She plans to combat the issue by supporting UW-Madison’s  request for funding to construct additional residence halls, which would ideally decrease the cost of living for students. “Yes, [it would be] a few million dollars, but that in comparison is a drop in the bucket… to other priorities or issue areas,” Bennett said. 
For those living off campus, or simply non-students residing in Madison, Bennett has continually advocated for cooperative housing and a tenant bill of rights.  
Her proposal would include granting greater negotiating power to tenants, preventing properties under the affordability requirement from expiring, conducting routine annual inspections to maintain health standards and requiring landlords to have reasonable grounds for evictions. 
While Bennett believes these solutions would be effective in managing the housing crisis in Madison, she acknowledges the need to address the root of the issue. 
“But truly, when the rubber hits the road, it's about creating affordability across the city and across the state. We just need to build more homes. Wisconsin is in a shortage of 200,000 affordable homes, and we currently don't have a plan to get there.” 
However, Bennett foresees an obstacle. She criticized Democrats, saying her own party lacks a clear consensus on issues relating to equal rights for women, transgender people and people of color.  
“I think that we need to have real come-to-Jesus moments within our party, and from the things that I'm hearing from residents and students and young people in Madison, it’s that we're tired of our elected leaders kind of selling us out,” Bennett said. “I think that there is a real issue of where our leaders, in the aura of trying to compromise, have become compromised themselves.” 
Reflecting on her time as a student activist at UW-Madison and her involvement in student government through the Associated Students of Madison, Bennett said her student experience shaped her desire to become the change she wanted to see in her party. 
This is why Bennett wants to reinstate the right to shared governance. ASM does not possess nearly as much power as it once did, Bennett explained, with much of its previous power having been relegated to the chancellor.  
Bennett said her journey from student activist to city alder to state assembly candidate underscores a commitment to turning personal struggle into public action.  
“You deserve a representative who has been in your shoes and fought for your needs. I will be that representative,” she said. 
Party primary election will take place on Aug. 11, with the Democratic candidate likely to win the seat on Nov. 3, 2026 in the heavily-Democratic district.

By the way, a new California law would limit community opposition to mid-rise apartment construction near transit hubs.
Additionally, Americans are OK with the industry’s wishes for streamlined project approvals. Faster permitting was popular: 65% approved vs. 17% disapproved.

The poll found 46% of Americans surveyed cited “materials used to build homes are too expensive.”
It’s not clear if that’s criticism or a sympathetic answer.
Elsewhere in the results, you see that when asked about barriers to affordability, 67% of those polled cited the focus of landlords and developers on high-profit projects. That’s a dig at the industry’s luxury push.
But Americans polled also agree with industry beefs about the costs builders incur.
Note that 76% of those polled saw construction costs and financing requirements as an affordability barrier, 66% acknowledged the challenges of limited land and infrastructure, and 55% saw shortages of workers and materials as a problem.
#3 Landlords
The poll found 43% of Americans surveyed cited “landlords are raising rents faster than necessary.”
Costs for tenants have skyrocketed in recent years, and it appears the industry has work to do to explain its pricing and potential solutions.
Consider the popularity of two fixes: rent control, the industry’s bane, and what developers want: easy construction of more units.
When asked about the impact of tactics to improve affordability, both rent freezes/caps and friendlier apartment zoning received approval from 34% of those polled, seeing the moves as cost-cutters.
But 26% fear rising costs from pro-apartment policies – likely tied to upscale development.
Contrast that to the 19% who saw rent control increasing expenses. Pricing limits can make costs higher for tenants who live in non-regulated units.
#4 Politicians
The poll found that 33% of Americans surveyed cited that “elected officials do not prioritize policies to make housing more affordable.”
So Americans do sympathize with the industry’s battles to increase housing supply.
Government approvals and community input for projects were seen as an affordability barrier by 61% of those polled, vs. 21% who didn’t see a concern. And zoning and regulation were a barrier to 68% of those surveyed, vs. 17% who didn’t.
By the way, a new California law would limit community opposition to mid-rise apartment construction near transit hubs.
Additionally, Americans are OK with the industry’s wishes for streamlined project approvals. Faster permitting was popular: 65% approved vs. 17% disapproved.

By Ethan Hartley 
The cost to affordably buy a median-priced home, or rent a median-priced apartment, now far exceeds the income of the average person looking to do so. And that reality holds true whether you are looking to live in Woonsocket, Little Compton, or anywhere in between.

The 2025 Housing Fact Book, released last week by HousingWorks RI — a research hub based out of Roger Williams University in Bristol that strives to “inform public policy, develop communications strategies, and promote dialogue about the relationship between housing and the state’s economic future and residents’ well-being” — painted the bleakest picture of the state’s affordable housing situation yet.

“In 2024…analysis noted the first time Rhode Islanders required an income of more than $100,000 to affordably buy a home in every Rhode Island municipality,” the report’s executive summary reads. “While that continues to be the case, this year it is now also true that renting—for the first time—requires an income that exceeds the renter median income ($48,434) to affordably rent in every municipality.”

According to the fact book, the cost of a median-priced, single-family home in Rhode Island is now $475,000, requiring a monthly housing payment (on average) of $3,957. That represents a 64 percent increase over 2019, when the median-priced home was $288,792 in the state. For context, a $475,000 home would require a household income of $158,263 to afford. 

The median household income of all Rhode Islanders, per the fact book, is $86,372. For homeowners, the median income was $112,858.

“Based on 2024 median single family home prices, a household would need an annual income close to $130,000 to affordably buy a home in any Rhode Island municipality,” the report reads. “This exceeds the median household income by more than $40,000 and median owner income by more than $17,000.”

The rental situation is no sunnier.

According to the data the average, two-bedroom rental in Rhode Island now costs $2,316 a month, representing a 16 percent increase over 2019, when the average rent was $1,988. A $2,316 per month rent would require a household income of $92,640 to afford without hardship.

The average annual household income for a renter in Rhode Island, meanwhile, is just $48,434.

“Since 2018, wages have grown by less than 30 percent but housing costs in the Ocean State have increased by over 60 percent,” the report reads. “More recently, Rhode Island’s single family home prices have jumped higher and faster than anywhere else in the country and rental increases are currently the steepest in New England.” 

Comparing prices
The most “affordable” place to buy a home in Rhode Island, per the data, is Pawtucket, which would require a $128,635 household income to buy a median-priced home. That is followed by Woonsocket, West Warwick, Central Falls, Warwick, Coventry, East Providence, North Providence, Cranston, and Burrillville to round out the top 10.

Block Island is by far the most expensive community to own a home, requiring a $521,723 annual household income to purchase a median priced home.

The top 10 most expensive communities (excluding Block Island) to buy a median-priced home in Rhode Island are: Jamestown ($357,068 annual income required); Newport ($307,638); Little Compton ($277,754); Narragansett ($265,655); East Greenwich ($264,823); Barrington ($249,379); Middletown ($226,456); Portsmouth ($219,420); North Kingstown ($208,277); and West Greenwich ($205,191).

In terms of East Bay municipalities, East Providence is the most “affordable”, requiring an income of $143,048 to but a median-priced home. That is followed by Tiverton ($149,159); Warren ($174,943); Bristol ($191,440); Portsmouth ($219,420); Barrington ($249,379); and Little Compton ($277,754).

The cheapest place to find a rental apartment, per the data, is Westerly (requiring a $60,320 income to affordably rent a two-bedroom apartment). That is followed by Woonsocket ($62,680); Central Falls ($67,520); Lincoln ($76,440); Pawtucket ($78,080); Bristol and East Greenwich (both $80,080); Newport ($81,960); Smithfield ($82,120); and Coventry ($83,520) to round out the top 10.

East Providence, in contrast to being the seventh-most affordable Rhode Island municipality to buy a home, was found to be the eighth-most expensive place to rent in Rhode Island, requiring an income of $94,800 to afford a two-bedroom apartment. 

Fourteen municipalities, including Barrington and Little Compton, did not have sufficient rental data to be included in this ranking of rental costs. 
One-third of households are cost burdened
The report found that, consistent with prior years, a full one-third of Rhode Island households (142,920 of 436,902 total) are “cost burdened”, meaning they spend more than one-third of their total annual income on housing costs. In the most recent data, they found that 44 percent of those cost-burdened households (62,237) are severely cost-burdened, meaning that they spend over 50 percent of their annual income on housing.

These figures get worse when separated by ethnicity. More than a third of Black home owners (35 percent) and Hispanic homeowners (39 percent) are cost-burdened, compared to 24 percent of white homeowners and 19 percent of Asian homeowners. 

The data also reveals that it is not just young people looking for homes that aren’t making enough money. Nearly 30 percent of the more than 60,000 severely cost-burdened households in Rhode Island (18,475) are mortgaged homeowners with incomes under $68,000, commonly elderly people on fixed incomes. 

The majority of severely cost-burdened households (37,466) are those without a mortgage, and renters making annual household incomes less than $40,000. 

Housing production is up, but more investment needed
While the report recognizes that the Rhode Island legislature has spent the last three years passing numerous laws intended to boost housing production in the state in the hopes to better meet demand and drive down costs, the data also revealed that more work, and monetary investment, is needed.

On the good side, the report states that more than $330 million in pandemic-related funding went to the creation of more than 1,835 new affordable homes, enabling 1,672 people to become new homeowners, and the creation of 1,400 shelter beds for those experiencing homelessness. 

However, the report found that overall, more than 80 percent of the state’s $44 million in efforts to bolster affordable housing for the federal program year that ended on June 30, 2024 came from federal funding sources, creating a precarious situation when it comes to the future availability of those funds.

“With…the uncertainty of future federal funding, it is crucial that state investments include permanent streams of revenue to continue forward momentum,” the report states. 

It goes on to praise the recent creation of a five-year pilot program, infused with $30 million initially, to create a low-income housing state tax credit program, as well as the $120 million state housing bond that passed in the 2024 election.

The report showed that, while the state saw 2,818 total housing permits issued in 2024 (a 15 percent increase over 2023), a large chunk of that was due to a 25 percent increase in single-family home permits. 

Multifamily home permits, which do more to address the widespread need of housing, only increased by 3 percent in the same span. Furthermore, the state saw 130 fewer multifamily permits in Q1 of 2025 than in Q1 of 2024.

Accessory dwelling units (ADUs), which since late 2024 have been made easier to be built by-right by homeowners to provide additional housing units on existing parcels, showed a significant albeit still small increase in the overall number of permits — from 28 in 2023, to 163 in 2024. 

Overall, the report showed that only eight municipalities in Rhode Island have achieved the state’s goal for each city and town to have 10 percent of its total housing stock be deemed “affordable”. Those municipalities are: Burrillville (10.19 percent); Central Falls (17.76 percent); East Providence (10.64 percent); Newport (17.27 percent); Pawtucket (10.41 percent); Providence (16.59 percent); West Warwick (10.6 percent); and Woonsocket (17.09 percent).

Poll: Housing industry is part of affordability problem

What’s the biggest cause of high housing costs in the nation?

Industry insiders answer that government bureaucracy slows or prevents the construction of new housing, compounded by the public’s “not-in-my-backyard” aversion to adding homes in their neighborhoods.

Well, one poll shows the typical American thinks the industry needs to look at itself, too. The Searchlight Institute’s recent poll of 2,123 U.S. adults on housing provides another perspective on the grand affordability debate.

Also see: Southern California home sales slump to another record low

There’s no argument about the scope of the financial burden, as 93% of those polled said housing was overly expensive – with 43% saying “way too high.”

But one question summed up the doubts about the industry’s contention that housing construction is the best cure for affordability.

The poll asked: “Do you believe that increasing the number of homes in your community will lower prices or raise prices?”

The results showed 44% of those polled saw development as raising prices vs. 24% seeing price declines.

Some industry insiders and policy wonks will say the public needs a few economics lessons. More supply should lower prices.

But what many Americans see is construction that focuses on higher-end residences. To those eyes, that’s increasing their local housing cost.

The industry is currently burdened with huge inventories of unsold new houses and empty new apartments, which are offered at what many see as inflated prices. Perhaps those selling homes and leasing rentals should rethink customer concerns about affordability.

Consider who Americans blamed when the poll sought rankings of affordability roadblocks. Look at what drew the most votes as examples of housing policy’s disconnect.

#1 Investors

The poll found 48% of Americans surveyed cited “investors are buying up housing to turn a profit” as a big cause of high housing costs.

Numerous industry insiders argue that investors are good for the market. Their cash provides liquidity, particularly as buyers when others won’t take the risk.

Critics say investor cash inflates prices above what many house hunters can afford, essentially squeezing out first-time buyers. Tax breaks for investors give them further advantages in the marketplace.

Another poll question details Americans’ unease with “institutional” house investors – a minor but controversial slice of the market.

When asked what would happen to home prices if banks or corporations were banned from homeownership, 36% of those polled said prices would decrease, vs. 22% who thought they’d rise.

#2 Construction costs

The poll found 46% of Americans surveyed cited “materials used to build homes are too expensive.”

It’s not clear if that’s criticism or a sympathetic answer.

Elsewhere in the results, you see that when asked about barriers to affordability, 67% of those polled cited the focus of landlords and developers on high-profit projects. That’s a dig at the industry’s luxury push.

But Americans polled also agree with industry beefs about the costs builders incur.

Note that 76% of those polled saw construction costs and financing requirements as an affordability barrier, 66% acknowledged the challenges of limited land and infrastructure, and 55% saw shortages of workers and materials as a problem.

#3 Landlords

The poll found 43% of Americans surveyed cited “landlords are raising rents faster than necessary.”

Costs for tenants have skyrocketed in recent years, and it appears the industry has work to do to explain its pricing and potential solutions.

Consider the popularity of two fixes: rent control, the industry’s bane, and what developers want: easy construction of more units.

When asked about the impact of tactics to improve affordability, both rent freezes/caps and friendlier apartment zoning received approval from 34% of those polled, seeing the moves as cost-cutters.

Additionally, Americans are OK with the industry’s wishes for streamlined project approvals. Faster permitting was popular: 65% approved vs. 17% disapproved.

 Seattle District 2 Council race: Eddie Lin runs on housing affordability  
  Oct. 18, 2025 at 6:00 am  

 By  
 Alexandra Yoon-Hendricks  
Seattle Times staff reporter   
 
When Eddie Lin first moved to Seattle more than 20 years ago, he and his then-girlfriend scraped by with low-paying jobs while earning college degrees. It wasn’t easy, he said, but it was doable. 
But the reality of an affordable city with opportunity for all seems to be slipping away. 
Lin and his now-wife have raised their two children in the Beacon Hill neighborhood, “but I don’t know how they’re going to afford to live here,” he said. His mother, now 86, recently retired and is planning to move to the city. On a fixed income with limited savings, the rental market is looking tough, he said. 
“We see our city transforming, and not in a good direction on affordability,” said Lin, 48, on a recent morning at The Station coffee shop on Beacon Hill. “It’s not easy to change trajectories, but we do have things that we can do.”
Lin, an assistant attorney at the Seattle city attorney’s office currently on sabbatical, is running for the City Council District 2 seat left open after Tammy Morales stepped down in January, triggering a special election. His challenger is Adonis Ducksworth, communications and policy adviser at the Seattle Department of Transportation. 
District 2 encompasses Beacon Hill, Chinatown International District, Columbia City, Rainier Beach and Seward Park. It is the city’s most racially diverse district and among its most economically mixed.

Tackling housing affordability, and the issues surrounding it like homelessness and public safety, are central to Lin’s campaign. To promote a flourishing community, Seattle and Washington state must increase taxes on big businesses and wealthy residents, he said, while reducing the financial burden on working families and low-income households. 
Most of his work at the Seattle city attorney’s office has been with the city’s Office of Housing, where he implemented policies related to affordable housing, new development and anti-displacement. 
He helped negotiate the transfer of surplus property from Sound Transit and the University of Washington to the city for affordable housing construction in South Seattle, and shepherded the Four Amigos affordable housing project in Columbia City.  
“I bring that skill set of understanding housing finance, understanding our regulations,” Lin said.  
His experience and priorities appear to have resonated — in the Aug. 5 primary, Lin received about 47% of the vote, while his challenger Ducksworth received about 29%. But Lin, whose public service work remains relatively unknown to many, continues to hit the pavement and meet voters.
Moving to Seattle 
Lin grew up in North Carolina and Massachusetts, before moving to Minnesota to attend Macalester College where he met his wife.

She graduated, but Lin had yet to finish school, having struggled with some mental health challenges. Ready to leave the Midwest, they road tripped across the West Coast before settling in Seattle in the late 1990s.
His wife taught reading at Dunlap Elementary as an AmeriCorps tutor, and Lin picked up odd jobs. Renting an apartment in Interbay, Lin completed his credits and graduated, while his wife earned a master’s degree at the University of Washington in 2001.
The couple moved to Oakland, Calif., where Lin got a job as a receptionist at a law firm and his wife became a teacher and active member of her union. Lin later joined a San Francisco firm that represented labor groups and championed progressive causes around living wages and voting rights, inspiring him to go to law school.   

“It was just very exciting for me to see attorneys doing this very impactful work,” Lin said. 
They returned to Seattle, and Lin went on to work as an attorney at Perkins Coie. But in the back of his mind, Lin said, he wanted to do something more community service oriented, a feeling that grew stronger when President Donald Trump was elected in 2016. 
Housing affordability
Long term, the city needs more dense, walkable neighborhoods with good public transit, Lin said.

“That’s how we’re going to address this multitude of issues around affordability, around climate change, around resilience, around public safety,” Lin said.
The city needs to make it easier and cheaper to build all housing types, he said. Seattle’s growth plan should have included more neighborhood centers, he said, and eliminated parking minimums.
Lin said he supports broader renter protections, such as the recently passed statewide cap on annual rent increases. He also wants to increase city dollars to help keep affordable housing developers and nonprofit groups up and running.

Stephanie Velasco, a city planning educator who’s worked with Lin, said he is adept at navigating complicated issues. She pointed to his work in implementing the city’s “community preference” housing policy, which encourages city-funded housing projects to consider neighborhood ties when selecting occupants.
“As the lawyer in the room … he could’ve really easily said, ‘No, there’s too much risk,’ ” Velasco said.
Instead, Lin helped ensure the policy was shielded from the lawsuits other cities saw over similar efforts, but remained an effective tool to promote racial equity, Velasco said.

Homelessness
For too long, District 2 has been the primary victim of Seattle’s failure to address homelessness, said Sharon Maeda, a longtime activist in South Seattle and former journalist, referencing Little Saigon and ongoing public safety issues there.  
Maeda said she’s been disappointed before by candidates, but Lin impressed her with his understanding of what’s working — and what’s not. 
“You can’t do it overnight, and what I appreciate about Eddie the most is he really is a thoughtful thinker, and he knows how to pull pieces together,” she said. 

Lin does not support the mayor’s effort to increase encampment removals, saying it’s a costly policy that traumatizes and pushes people around while failing to address root causes of homelessness. 
The city needs to increase its behavioral health services and drug treatment capacity, build more low-barrier shelters and fund more supportive housing, Lin said. 
Public safety
On a recent weekend of doorknocking, Lin came across Ronald Cabang at his childhood home, helping his parents fry lumpia in the garage. When Lin asked Cabang what city officials should prioritize, the answer was quick. 
 
Advertising 

Just last week, Cabang said, someone snatched his mother’s necklace right off her neck as she was gardening. She didn’t report the incident to police.
“Her English isn’t really good, so they don’t really communicate with police officers,” Cabang said. “They feel like they just have to deal with things but at the same time I can’t do anything either.”
Stories like that are part of why Lin supports hiring more police officers, he said, with a focus on hiring diverse officers who speak different languages. He also wants to beef up youth programs to reduce gun violence and delinquency. 
Lin said the city should invest more in its CARE department, the nonemergency police alternative. The Seattle Police Department overall, he said, is in need of greater accountability and civilian oversight. 
Progressive revenue 
Lin is a staunch critic of the state’s regressive tax code, which forces the city’s poorest residents to contribute a greater share of their income toward taxes than wealthier neighbors. As a council member, Lin said he would work with state lawmakers to advocate for a state income tax. 
He would like to see a local capital gains tax or a higher rate for the city’s existing JumpStart tax initiative, a payroll tax on large businesses with high-earning employees intended to fund affordable housing. 
“We’re never going to be able to meet the needs of our community without fixing our upside down tax code,” Lin said.

Improving affordability has been one of the big talking points by politicians at both the state and federal levels. There has been talk of President Trump declaring a housing emergency to try to tackle the issue.
At the state level, some progress has been made in reducing red tape, which has helped more housing developments be built in cities where housing shortages have been a major issue. However, some cities are fighting those regulations.
One such case is unfolding in Texas, where the state government passed a bipartisan bill to allow multifamily housing developments in areas zoned for commercial use. One rental economist pointed out that the law is being met with local resistance.
Jay Parsons (pictured top) is a rental economist who previously spent more than 15 years at RealPage, Inc. He now runs his own consulting firm and is an economic advisor for JPI, a real estate company in Dallas. He noted on his LinkedIn page on Wednesday that cities in Texas are imposing significant restrictions to prevent those multifamily structures from being built easily.
“Cities like to think they know what's best for their city, but many of them have dated stereotypes of renters and rental housing,” Parsons told Mortgage Professional America. “They need quality rental housing to make it affordable for the teachers, firefighters, and retail workers who are critical to any city. The best thing they can do is focus on how to ensure more quality housing gets built, and to reduce obstacles and red tape to making it happen.”
City restrictions
He noted in a LinkedIn post that The Texas Tribune reported on some of these restrictions, which could prevent the construction of these multifamily properties. This impacts the commercial market because companies are less likely to build in these areas, and it affects the consumer space as ongoing housing shortages will keep home prices higher.
“New apartments in Irving must have at least eight floors (no garden properties!),” Parsons noted in his post. “The Texas Tribune reported buildings also ‘must include a swimming pool, a dog park, a gym and a workspace for remote workers. Builders must also pick from a menu of amenities to add, such as a yoga room, a place to wash pets or cars or a station for cyclists to repair their bikes.’”
Similar laws were passed in Arlington, where apartment builders were required to include certain amenities like swimming pools or basketball courts, and at least 15% of parking spots must include electric vehicle charging stations.
In Frisco, the city changed its zoning code to allow heavy industry in the same areas where these multifamily properties could be built. Even though it is unlikely the city would actually approve heavy industry in those areas, it could be enough to scare off any developers.
He noted that the cities in Texas were following a playbook similar to how Los Angeles has limited the types of properties that can be built.
“When you choke off housing, you drive up housing costs in the long run,” Parsons said. “Then, maybe decades from now, you'll have a housing shortage and an affordability crisis. And, like Los Angeles, you'll blame everyone but yourselves and your anti-housing policies.”
Parsons said the challenges of affordability are an ongoing battle between those in higher-income brackets and lower-income customers.
“The reality is affordability is a bifurcated issue of haves and have-nots,” he said. “Census data shows us renter households making more than $50,000 spend only 22% of income on rent, whereas lower-income households spend 53%. The good news is that wage growth has outpaced rent growth for almost three years, so at the top half of the market, affordability is not a major headwind for renters spending 22% of income on rent. But there are still challenges at the lower end of the market.”
Help on the way?
Despite pushback from cities and other local governments, states will continue to try to alleviate the housing affordability issue. It then becomes a battle between those who would say yes and those who would say no to projects in their backyards.
“The YIMBY movement has made major gains, particularly within state government,” Parsons said. “State legislators in states both red and blue are increasingly educated on how the only way to solve the housing affordability and availability issues is to build more housing.”
Kimber White returned as president of NAMB with a clear mission. He aimed to tackle housing affordability by urging changes to loan-level price adjustments and calling for practical government solutions to help first-time buyers.https://t.co/fyyruihgIB
— Mortgage Professional America Magazine (@MPAMagazineUS) October 13, 2025
If cities and states continue to battle on the issue, the federal government may step in. In addition to a possible housing emergency, Parsons noted that the federal government has more options at its disposal to both force changes and provide assistance.
“It's difficult because housing is mostly a local issue, but the federal government does have tools it can use,” he said. “In particular, the federal government could set rules around the use of federal tax dollars to build housing, especially affordable housing via the Low Income Housing Tax Credit.
“That could include things like preventing states and cities from layering in additional requirements of developers that would raise the costs of construction, making federal spending more efficient and resulting more units built. The expansion of LIHTC and Opportunity Zones in the Big Beautiful Bill is also impactful.”

NYC mayoral candidates on affordability All three of the New York City mayoral candidates have made their thoughts known on how best to address the issue of affordability in the city. FOX 5 NY's Lisa Evers recounts their answers. The Brief The 2025 election for New York City's next mayor is three weeks away.Polls indicate that housing access and affordability are some of the top issues for New Yorkers heading into the ballot box on Nov. 4.All three candidates intend to expand the production of housing in the city, but have different ideas on how to go about doing so. Mamdani additionally wants to freeze rent. NEW YORK - The 2025 election for New York City's next mayor is three weeks away, and polls indicate that housing access and affordability are some of the top issues for New Yorkers heading into the ballot box.
The cost of housing is one of the main factors contributing to population loss in the state, according to research conducted by the Fiscal Policy Institute.

The race is down to three major candidates: Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and conservative activist and talk show host Curtis Sliwa. Here's where the three candidates stand on addressing the housing crisis in New York.

Bookmark our Election Results page to track in real-time, and tune into our Election Night coverage live right here on fox5ny.com and FOX LOCAL New York as the night unfolds. Coverage begins at 4 p.m. Mamdani on housing and affordability  What they're saying: Mamdani has made affordability the cornerstone of his campaign. Speaking on Good Day New York, Mamdani called his campaign ""a coalition that includes organizations and individuals of a wide variety, all of whom are united on affordability."" His housing plan, for example, has four pillars, according to his campaign website.  He plans to freeze rent for all stabilized tenants as mayor and ""use every available resource"" to build additional housing throughout the city.

""The number one reason working families are leaving our city is the housing crisis,"" his platform states. ""The Mayor has the power to change that."" According to the New York City Charter Revision Commission, NYC faces ""what is likely the worst housing affordability crisis in its history."" As mayor, Mamdani plans to triple New York's production of ""permanently affordable, union-built, rent-stabilized homes"" in order to construct 200,000 units over the next decade. He also plans to ""overhaul"" the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants and ""coordinate code enforcement under one roof"" in order to ensure agencies work together to hold landlords accountable for the conditions of the buildings they own.  Mamdani also plans to create a new Office of Deed Theft Prevention to protect homeowners from a ""system that favors wealthier homeowners in gentrifying neighborhoods.""  ""Home ownership is out of reach for too many,"" Mamdani wrote on X in May. ""And those who do own face rising costs and predatory scams. I saw these challenges up close as a foreclosure prevention counselor. As Mayor, I'll make city government work for you."" Mamdani has also proposed making MTA buses and child care free.  Cuomo on housing and affordability  Former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is now running as an independent after losing the Democratic primary to Mamdani, states in his platform that New York City faces a crisis of affordability and a crisis of housing. ""Our city has always been expensive, but today it is rapidly becoming unaffordable for millions of hard-working New Yorkers at all income levels,"" Cuomo states on his campaign website. ""The existing supply of housing is increasingly unaffordable, and its quality is deteriorating.""

This is why building ""more housing across all income levels"" is essential, Cuomo says. As mayor, Cuomo states that he'll additionally increase enforcement of rent-stabilization to address housing affordability. Cuomo also wants to provide ""targeted tax relief to lower-income and middle-class voters, including homeowners,"" as well as ""leverage public land"" for affordable and mixed-income housing development. Cuomo also wants to focus on making sure New Yorkers are making money. ""First priority: jobs, jobs, jobs,"" Cuomo said on Good Day New York. ""We're losing jobs, we're losing the economy, we're losing people. We have to focus on getting those jobs back into New York and growing.""  Sliwa on housing and affordability  While Sliwa agrees that building more affordable housing is important, he claims on his campaign website that ""this approach alone will not address the affordability crisis"" plaguing NYC.

Sliwa has a seven-point plan that he claims will make housing more affordable for working people. Some of his proposals include ""restoring"" the city's vacant rent-controlled apartments, ""expanding"" housing for seniors, ""converting commercial spaces into housing"" and ""restoring"" local zoning control.  ""Rather than handing control to corporate developers, I will ensure that zoning decisions prioritize affordability and community stability,"" his platform states. Sliwa has also proposed an income tax holiday to keep the next generation of college students and young professionals from leaving the city because they can't make ends meet. ""The income tax is another problem,"" he said on Good Day New York. ""Student loans are a problem, the rent is a problem, so we can deal with the things that are going to encourage them to stay. They got their education here – why can't we get them to stay here for five years?"" Why affordability matters to New Yorkers Dig deeper: The city faces a housing crisis in general. According to the NYC Department of Homeless Services, roughly 86,000 New Yorkers stayed in a city-run shelter on a typical night this past August. Plus, according to the 2025 Income and Affordability Study conducted by the New York City Rent Guidelines Board, the median New Yorker spent roughly a third of their income last year on rent alone.  More broadly, the cost of living in New York City is far above the national average. In fact, a report released earlier this year by wealth firm Henley & Partners deemed it the second-most expensive city in the world.  The Source: Information above was sourced from the Fiscal Policy Institute, the NYC Department of Homeless Services, the New York City Rent Guidelines Board, wealth firm Henley & Partners and previous FOX 5 NY reporting. Information from the New York City Charter Revision Commission, The City, PBS and X were also referenced.

Share this storyA pioneering housing experiment in Dorchester is showcasing micro-apartments designed to be affordable and efficient.Built over four years by Vivian and Elisa Girard, a couple with construction expertise in Fields Corner, the entire 14-unit micro-apartment building was constructed using recycled materials. The project, part of Boston's Compact Living Pilot Program, offers smaller-than-standard studio apartments — each approximately 280 square feet.Vivian shared that she independently navigated complex permitting processes for the building's construction.The couple previously renovated a triple-decker and opened Homestead Café in Fields Corner in 2016. There, they met Julie Baker, a regular customer and co-producer of a storytelling show hosted at the café.Baker, a single mother who previously lived in a large duplex and a substandard apartment, now finds her micro-unit transformative. She described the importance of light and minimal possessions for her happiness.“I love it so much,” she said in a statement shared with NBC10 Boston. “I was worried I'd feel cramped. I don't. The windows help, all the light helps — light is very important to me.”The Girards' building includes shared amenities like laundry, bike storage, and a backyard mural painted by Elisa that borders a community garden. Each unit rents for $750 to $870 per month, including heat and hot water. Tenants pay for electricity and internet.Baker explained that the micro-apartments embody a minimalist lifestyle that rejects consumerism. Tenants here value light, space, and simplicity, viewing micro-living as a way to reduce material possessions.The project, which has received considerable community support, has all units currently occupied and a long waiting list.“It helps to try a new initiative like this,” Vivian said in a statement shared with NBC10 Boston. “Not everything works, but if you don't try, you never find out.”Share this storyBostonDorchesterMichael VyskocilWriterRelated StoriesLocal NewsReport: Boston Harbor Visitor Numbers Drop by Half of 2019 LevelsMichael VyskocilLocal NewsMassachusetts Secures $106 Million in Federal Funding for Transit UpgradesMichael VyskocilLocal News170 Mass.

2025-10-16 20:00:00,"Incumbent Muskegon Mayor Ken Johnson debated opponent Bob Garretson ahead of the Nov. 4 election in front of a sizeable crowd Sunday, Oct. 12, at the Stage at The Corner in downtown Muskegon.Photo by Ehren WynderBy Ehren Wynder | ewynder@mlive.comMUSKEGON, MI — Ahead of the November election, Muskegon Mayor Ken Johnson faced off against Bob Garrettson at a debate on Sunday, Oct. 12, at the Stage at The Corner at 280 W. Muskegon Ave. The forum-style debate was hosted by Muskegon Engaged, a local organization seeking to inform the public on political happenings. Maggie Doyle, one of the organization’s founders, and John Horne, a local high school government teacher, served as moderators.Johnson, who was first elected mayor in 2021, is running for a second four-year term on the Nov. 4 ballot. Garrettson, his opponent, is a financial planner and U.S. Navy veteran who moved to Muskegon in 2019.The mayoral race was narrowed down to Johnson and Garretson after the two were declared the top vote-getters in the August primary. Johnson came in first place with 2,043 votes, and Garretson placed second with 1,011 votes.Johnson and Garretson on Sunday evening debated a range of local and national topics, including housing, economic development and how city leaders should respond to federal issues like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).On the subject of development in the wake of the $80 million cleanup of Muskegon Lake, candidates were asked how they would ensure growth benefits longtime residents and doesn’t push them out.Garretson said his campaign commitment, “housing for all,” includes all levels from low income to luxury lakefront housing, but his primary focus is on middle-income housing.“We need to make sure that the residents that live in our downtown areas are also getting help to stay in place and age in place,” he said. “It also would free up housing that is appropriate for new homeowners.” Johnson said, while high-income housing is vital to the city’s tax base, it is important that Muskegon’s waterfront economy does not become monopolized by the ultra-wealthy.“We hear sometimes it’s too focused on low-income housing, that there’s too much of it, and that people who can’t afford to live here will just move east,” he said. “I think that’s ridiculous. We need to make sure our community is welcoming for everyone regardless of economic backgrounds.”When asked how they will strengthen the year-round economy while ensuring affordability for residents, Johnson pointed to the pay-to-park program at Pere Marquette Park, which the city uses to generate revenue for the overall parks system.With tourism, Johnson said he embraces it, but doesn’t want Muskegon to be a tourism-dominated economy. “Manufacturing has been a critical core of our economy for decades, and while it’s no longer at the height it was a century ago, it is still important,” he said. “We need to make sure that we support our manufacturers and ensure there is a future for them, because manufacturing is how we import wealth into our community.”Johnson also touted an effort he was a part of during his tenure on the city commission to halt development of the dunes at Pere Marquette.When asked how he would attract outside investment while ensuring local businesses are not left behind, Garretson said the best way for Muskegon to continue economic development is by keeping what it has. We lost large numbers of jobs from our employers, and why that happens is because we don’t have relationships with them,” he said. “When I talked to the largest employer in the city, they’ve never spoken to the city about healthcare or employment issues.”Garretson recommended partnering with cities like Norton Shores and Grand Rapids that are having a “resurgence in economic development.”When asked about their response to ICE enforcement and occupation style policing coming from the Trump administration, Garretson said upholding the safety and civil rights of the community is not enough.“We have a Latino population that’s doubled in the last 15 years,” he said. “Without that growth, we would have shrunk in our total population, but in many ways they don’t feel like they belong.”To remedy this, Garretson proposed bilingual services for businesses or people who have been victims of violent crime or people who need mental health services.In response to the same question, Johnson said communities in Muskegon have “very real fears about the march toward authoritarianism in this country.”“Members of our community feel dejected, discriminated against and in jeopardy for their lives and that requires a coordinated response,” he said.Johnson pledged his city will not do the work of ICE in Muskegon, notably because notably because it already lacks the resources.“That doesn’t mean we are going to ignore the law if there is a judicial warrant,” he said. “But we’re not going to do the federal government’s work for them in regard to ICE enforcement.”Johnson further denounced the federal deployment of troops in Chicago and Portland as “abhorrent,” and proposed Muskegon partner with nearby cities so “we are not left alone to deal with the federal government and all that entails.”Later in the debate, the topic turned to a Nov. 4 ballot initiative to impose a 12-year term limit on members of the city commission.Johnson, who previously served eight years on the city commission, may be ineligible to serve if the charter amendment is enacted. While he fully expects to serve again as mayor if elected, he warned the amendment could lead to a lengthy legal battle if also passed.Garretson said plainly that he believes Muskegon should listen to the voters. Johnson, however, noted Muskegon has a fresh and young city commission, as well as a history of turning out longtime incumbents.Candidates for city commission also took the stage Sunday night to debate one another prior to the November election. Four candidates competing for two at-large seats, including Commissioner At Large Rebecca St. Clair, Teresa Emory, Kiley N. Jackson and John C. Allen. Emory did not attend Sunday’s debate forum.The candidates in attendance debated a range of topics, including housing affordability, equitable investment in infrastructure and maintaining public land.Ehren WynderEhren Wynder is a business and development reporter at MLive.com covering Ottawa and Muskegon counties. ewynder@mlive.com",https://www.fox5ny.com/news/where-mamdani-sliwa-cuomo-stand-housing-access-affordability,"New Yorker, United States",42.1497,-74.9384,43,fox5ny.com

Share this storyA pioneering housing experiment in Dorchester is showcasing micro-apartments designed to be affordable and efficient.Built over four years by Vivian and Elisa Girard, a couple with construction expertise in Fields Corner, the entire 14-unit micro-apartment building was constructed using recycled materials. The project, part of Boston's Compact Living Pilot Program, offers smaller-than-standard studio apartments — each approximately 280 square feet.Vivian shared that she independently navigated complex permitting processes for the building's construction.The couple previously renovated a triple-decker and opened Homestead Café in Fields Corner in 2016. There, they met Julie Baker, a regular customer and co-producer of a storytelling show hosted at the café.Baker, a single mother who previously lived in a large duplex and a substandard apartment, now finds her micro-unit transformative. She described the importance of light and minimal possessions for her happiness.“I love it so much,” she said in a statement shared with NBC10 Boston. “I was worried I'd feel cramped. I don't. The windows help, all the light helps — light is very important to me.”The Girards' building includes shared amenities like laundry, bike storage, and a backyard mural painted by Elisa that borders a community garden. Each unit rents for $750 to $870 per month, including heat and hot water. Tenants pay for electricity and internet.Baker explained that the micro-apartments embody a minimalist lifestyle that rejects consumerism. Tenants here value light, space, and simplicity, viewing micro-living as a way to reduce material possessions.The project, which has received considerable community support, has all units currently occupied and a long waiting list.“It helps to try a new initiative like this,” Vivian said in a statement shared with NBC10 Boston. “Not everything works, but if you don't try, you never find out.”Share this storybostonBostonDorchesterMichael VyskocilWriterRelated StoriesLocal NewsReport: Boston Harbor Visitor Numbers Drop by Half of 2019 LevelsMichael VyskocilLocal NewsMassachusetts Secures $106 Million in Federal Funding for Transit UpgradesMichael VyskocilLocal News170 Mass.

2025-10-13 16:00:00,"Kate Keefer is a resident of the Riverton Community in Portland.
Portland has a housing crisis, but we need to be precise about what that crisis actually is. The problem isn’t housing quantity — it’s housing affordability. According to Zillow, Portland currently has 271 rental units available. Yet only 28 of those units — slightly more than 10% — rent for under $1,800 per month.
To understand why this matters, consider the economics: Maine’s median hourly wage is $24.19. A full-time worker at that wage can afford roughly $1,262 in monthly rent under thefederal standard established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that housing costs should not exceed 30% of income.
A minimum wage worker earning $14.65/hour can afford just $762 per month. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition’s 2025 Out of Reach report, a worker would need to earn $28.42 per hour — well above Maine’s median wage — just to afford a two-bedroom apartment at fair market rent.
The result is that 53% of Maine renters are now cost-burdened, paying more than 30% of their income on housing — up from 32% just five years ago. There are only 52 affordable units available for every 100 extremely low-income households statewide. Yet the Portland Planning Board continues approving developments that barely address this reality.
The recently approved Belfort Landing project exemplifies the disconnect: 50 new units, with only 13 designated as “affordable” — just 25%. When nearly 90% of our rental housing need is for truly affordable units, building developments that are 75% market-rate doesn’t solve the problem.This pattern isn’t unique to Belfort Landing. Across Portland, market-rate and luxury housing dominates new construction because they are more profitable. The Planning Board approves these projects in the name of “adding housing supply,” while Portland’s low- and middle-income families continue to be priced out.
The data are clear: we’re not experiencing a housing shortage. We’re experiencing an affordable housing shortage. Adding more expensive units to our inventory doesn’t help the librarian, the barista, the electrician or the cop who can’t find housing they can afford.
The Planning Board and City Council have tools to demand better. They can require substantially higher percentages of affordable units in new developments.
They can prioritize projects that serve demonstrated community needs over developer profit margins. They can ensure that “adding housing” actually means adding housing that working Portlanders can afford.
Until our city officials make this distinction and act on it, we’ll continue building the wrong thing — adding units to our inventory while families leave Portland because they simply can’t afford to stay.
Portland deserves responsible development that serves its residents, not just its real estate market.

Gov. Gavin Newsom is signing a bill that would allow for more homes to be built near transit stations, in an effort to address California's high housing costs.In a statement Friday, the governor said he is signing Senate Bill 79, a measure sponsored by state Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco).""For too long, California has poured billions into transit without building the housing density needed for those systems to reach their potential,"" Newsom said. The governor said having more homes near transit would provide multiple benefits, including boosting ridership, cutting traffic and pollution, lowering housing costs and expanding access to jobs, schools and services.Newsom added, ""The world looks to California for leadership -- it's time to build modern, connected communities that fulfill California's promise, meeting the needs of today and the next generation.""
The signing of Senate Bill 79 is the latest attempt to increase homebuilding to tackle the state's housing costs, which remain among the highest in the country. Earlier this year, Newsom signed Assembly Bill 130 and Senate Bill 131, which reforms the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) to speed up the building of housing and infrastructure.  Years in the makingIn a separate statement, Wiener, said, ""In California we talk a lot about where we don't want to build homes, but rarely about where we do — until now. SB 79 unwinds decades of overly restrictive land use policies that have driven housing costs to astronomical levels, forcing millions of people to move far away from jobs and transit, to face massive commutes, or to leave California entirely."" Wiener, who was first elected to the State Senate in 2016, has proposed multiple zoning reform bills aiming to boost the number of homes near transit, including Senate Bill 827 in 2018 and Senate Bill 50 in 2020. Both attempts failed to gain passage in the legislature.Senate Bill 79 passed the legislature last month with a 43-19 vote in the Assembly and a 21-8 vote in the State Senate.
Where does SB79 apply?According to supporters, SB79 sets standards for allowable housing development within a half mile of train stops and bus rapid transit stops that meet specific criteria. The measure applies only to a handful of counties designated as an ""urban transit county"" in California, including Alameda, Los Angeles, Orange, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, San Mateo and Santa Clara counties.For qualifying ""Tier 1"" stops, which includes stops along BART, Caltrain and LA Metro's B & D lines, housing up to 9 stories can be built adjacent to a transit stop, up to 7 stories will be allowed within a ¼ mile and up to 6 stories will be allowed between a ¼ and ½ mile of a stop.Qualifying stops in ""Tier 2"", which include some light rail lines such as Sac RT and San Francisco Muni, some stations on Metrolink and some rapid bus transit lines, housing up to 8 stories would be allowed next to the station, 6 stories within a ¼ mile and 5 stories within ¼ and ½ mile.In his signing statement, Newsom also pushed back on claims that the bill impacts any efforts to rebuild homes that were damaged in the Palisades and Eaton fires that devastated Southern California in January, saying there are no transit stops that qualify for the measure in the burn scars of either fire and that the measure has additional safeguards for fire-prone areas. A map provided by the Los Angeles Planning Department showed where the measure could apply in the state's most populous city, showing no transit stops in Pacific Palisades were covered.What people are saying about the billSupporters called it a long-overdue step to boost housing supply and reduce costs. Opponents, however, warned that it could lead to overdevelopment and diminish the voices of local communities. ""It's got the kind of quaint charm of an older city, a hometown vibe,"" said Xander Pisano, who moved to San Francisco's Glen Park neighborhood about eight months ago. ""It's also got the kind of edginess of a city on the outskirts.""
Pisano said he loves his neighborhood but worries how it might change if high-rise apartment buildings are built around the nearby Glen Park BART Station. Still, he understands the need to make housing more affordable.""If it can lower the rent, that's always a good thing,"" he said. ""But with that, there are pluses and negatives as well.""One of the main supporters, the non-profit California YIMBY organization, spent eight years pushing for the bill before the governor signed it into law.""It's a moment of validation.
It's a moment of celebration,"" said Matthew Lewis, communications director for California YIMBY. ""And really, it's a moment for the work to get started in actually implementing these laws.""""The affordability part of it is the big scam,"" said Susan Kirsch, founder and director of Catalyst for Local Control, a group that opposed the legislation. ""[These buildings] have no assurances, no promises of meeting the needs for those people who are living on minimum wages."" Supporters like California YIMBY disagreed, arguing that the law addresses the state's long-standing housing shortage through basic economics of increasing supply to help bring down prices. Office-to-home conversions, ADU building bills also approvedIn addition to SB79, Newsom announced the signing of several other measures to boost home construction, including Assembly Bill 507 by Asm. Matt Haney (D-San Francisco), which would streamline the conversion of office towers into housing.
""Across California, commercial real estate is taking a hit. Offices are losing tenants, property values are falling, and cities are bracing for a financial crunch. AB 507 offers a solution: turn unused office space into desperately needed housing,"" said a statement from Haney's office.Newsom also signed Senate Bill 543 by state Sen. Jerry McNerney (D-Stockton), which seeks to streamline the construction of accessory dwelling units (ADUs), small homes also known as backyard cottages or casitas.""California needs to build housing to help make our state more affordable. And one of the most effective ways to address our housing affordability crisis is to accelerate the construction of low-cost housing, like ADUs and junior ADUs,"" McNerney said in a statement.

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Homeownership rates fell in 2024 for the first time in eight years as soaring home prices made ownership unattainable for many, Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies found. As of early 2025, prices are up 60% nationwide since 2019 and still rising at a rate of 3.9% year over year, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index. Consequently, the U.S. median existing single-family home price hit a new high of $429,400 in 2025, according to the National Association of Realtors.
High prices aren't the only problem. The rise in mortgage rates since 2020 has also increased the income required to afford a typical home. In January 2020, the average 30-year fixed mortgage was around 3.72%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Today, it's around 6.30%. A Bankrate market study estimates that to afford a typical home, the average American household will need to make $117,000, which can be out of reach for a lot of families. Don't Miss:

How to make homeownership possible
Homeownership has become less affordable, but that doesn't mean it's impossible. Here are a few ways to lower your homeownership costs and make your dream of becoming a homeowner a reality. Look Into Home-Buying Assistance Programs Many federal, state and city programs often help with down payments, closing costs or lower interest rates for those who qualify. For example, FHA loans only require 3.5% down if you have at least a 580 credit score, and VA and USDA loans require no down payment as long as you meet the eligibility requirements.

You can always move up later as your income grows. Expand Your Search Radius If you're flexible with where you want to live, consider expanding your search radius since prices can differ pretty dramatically just a few miles away. Look at up-and-coming neighborhoods, nearby suburbs or small towns within commuting distance. Housing in these areas is generally more affordable compared to the city center.

Oakland, California, officials have a new take on a controversial housing program that hasn’t always delivered the affordability it promised struggling renters.

Across California, cities have signed on to a financing plan in which market-rate apartment buildings are bought and supposedly re-rented at rates affordable to teachers, nurses, and other middle-income workers. Instead, the deals often financially enriched bond investors and developers while delivering meager rent discounts — and causing local governments to lose millions in property taxes, an investigation by this news organization found.

As of 2025, Vancouver and Toronto rank as the first and third most unaffordable metropolitan areas among the 25 largest metropolitan areas in North America. 
The question is whether these cities have always been costly, or whether the surge in housing prices – or lagging income growth – pushed them further behind. 
The data reveal that population growth is a secondary factor. The population of Charlotte, N.C., nearly doubled, while Montreal’s rose only 23 per cent, yet Montreal’s housing prices climbed far more dramatically.

Twenty years of price growth

Between July, 2005, and July, 2025, Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto recorded the steepest home price increases among large North American metropolitan areas. Notably, Montreal now slightly edges out Toronto in 20-year price growth, owing in part to the recent price correction in the Greater Toronto Area.
Population growth is often seen as the prime driver of housing costs: More people mean more demand, which pushes prices higher. Yet the data reveal otherwise. 
Charlotte, Orlando and Houston posted the fastest population growth over the past 20 years, but their home price appreciation fell well below that of Canadian cities. Orlando, for instance, saw its population grow by 52 per cent – outpacing Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal – yet its housing prices increased far less than in those Canadian markets.

Supply and demand imbalances

Population growth alone cannot explain Canada’s housing price surge. Instead, persistent imbalances between housing supply and demand dominate.

On the supply side, restrictive zoning limits new housing, while lengthy approvals and high development fees raise costs. Rising material prices and shortages of skilled labour can also add pressure to final prices.
On the demand side, beyond population growth, speculative demand can play a significant role when housing is treated as an investment asset. As with most asset classes, price growth has far outpaced salary increases. Higher salaries and inflows of foreign capital may further tilt the equation by enabling higher bids in competitive markets.

The role of policy and speculation

As I noted in an earlier article, overly stimulative monetary policy between 2008 and 2017 added fuel to the fire. Rock-bottom interest rates encouraged speculative buying on top of genuine household demand. 
In Canada, comparatively low property taxes – unlike in the United States, where those taxes fund much of the K-12 school system – reduced the carrying cost of real estate and made it an even more attractive asset. Combined with steady inflows of foreign capital, these factors further reinforced speculative demand. 

Yet demand pressures alone cannot explain the surge. Cities such as Charlotte, with explosive population growth but far lower price appreciation, highlight the decisive role of supply constraints. Toronto, unconstrained by geography, still saw housing growth limited by zoning restrictions and regulatory barriers.

A convergence of forces

In the end, immigration-driven population growth has contributed to demand, but its role has been secondary. The affordability crisis stems primarily from stimulative monetary policy that supercharged speculation, paired with municipal and provincial regulations that restricted supply. Inflows of foreign capital and relatively low property tax rates further amplified speculative demand.
Together, these factors explain why Canadian metros now rank among the least affordable housing markets in North America. Until policy-makers address the demand distortions and the supply bottlenecks, affordability will remain out of reach.

Two Denver suburbs take different paths as residents face housing crunch: ‘We can manage it, but just barely’

By John Aguilar | jaguilar@denverpost.com | The Denver PostPUBLISHED: October 5, 2025 at 6:00 AM MDT Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...Two suburban cities south and west of Denver find themselves on distinctly different tracks in addressing a long-vexing problem — the high prices and elevated borrowing costs that box out young families and renters of all ages from buying a home.
In Lakewood, elected leaders spent the summer overhauling the city’s zoning code and land use rules. Their goal: to encourage the building of more varied housing types, and by extension greater density, in the city of 156,000, with the ultimate aim of lowering overall home prices.
In Littleton, a similar pro-density effort had sparked a furious backlash earlier this year. Now a citizen-initiated measure is bound for the Nov. 4 ballot and, if passed, it will restrict a large chunk of the city from having anything but single-family homes — a stark pivot from city leaders’ prior goal.
Each city is part of a larger density debate that has played out in communities across metro Denver and has dominated housing affordability discussions at all levels, from the Colorado statehouse to neighborhood streets.
Littleton City Councilwoman Andrea Peters, who is also a real estate agent, said the lack of “missing middle” housing in her city is having a chain-reaction effect on younger families seeking their first home as well as older people looking to downsize. That type of housing includes duplexes, triplexes and attached townhomes, which are designed to house more people per square foot but are less imposing than hulking apartment buildings or condos.
“We have an aging demographic and we don’t have a plan for younger families,” Peters said. “If we have more smaller-size options (for downsizers), that frees up that larger home for someone else.”
Mark Harris, an eight-year resident of Littleton, is part of a group dubbed Rooted in Littleton that is behind Measure 3A on this fall’s ballot. He says the goal is to stop the city from shoehorning certain housing types into neighborhoods where they don’t fit and where residents don’t want them.

“Our intent is to preserve single-family land use — that’s what we’re trying to do,” he said. “We are not anti-growth. We are not anti-affordable housing. We just don’t want duplexes, triplexes and quadplexes imposed on us.”
As high-level discussions on affordability have taken up much of the oxygen in policy debates in recent years, the issue has been tackled in the state Capitol. A collection of bills passed in 2024 and signed into law by Gov. Jared Polis was designed to increase higher-density living and bring home prices down.
Several Front Range municipalities have, in turn, sued the state, claiming its mandate to implement zoning-related changes encroached on their home rule powers to set their own land-use rules.
And at the center of it all is raw emotion.
“This place doesn’t resemble what it used to be — not at all,” said Regina Hopkins, a lifelong Lakewood resident who feels the growth in her city over the last couple decades has been out of control. “Why are local governments being forced to fix what is a state issue?”
Hopkins, 40, and others in Lakewood are exploring whether to put their own measure on the ballot to roll back what the city is expected to finalize on Oct. 13.
But for newcomer Robert Adams, Lakewood is doing the right thing. At 39, he finally got out of the rental game by purchasing a 1,200-square-foot, 1950s-era home in the city.
“After my years of renting, we bought 2½ years ago — and it’s quite a burden to afford a moderately-priced home,” he said.
While home prices have finally stagnated across metro Denver in recent months, they haven’t come down much from their record levels. The median price gain of a residential property sold in August in metro Denver was 0.3% compared to the same month a year earlier, rising to $587,000, according to a recent report from Homes.com. That was below the 2.4% annual price gain seen nationally, the site said.
In August 2021, when values were surging, metro Denver home prices rose 17.4% compared to a year earlier.
While some experts say the local housing scene has flipped to a buyer’s market, high mortgage rates are keeping things tough for those on the hunt for a listing. Adams paid $650,000 for his Lakewood house, and he carries a 6.6% interest rate on his loan.
“We can manage it, but just barely,” he said.
Need for ‘missing middle’ housing
The Lakewood City Council has already approved three rounds of updates to the city’s zoning code. Those include measures allowing diverse housing stock anywhere in the city, limiting new home sizes to 5,000 square feet, and encouraging the conversion of vacant or underused commercial buildings to housing.
Council members will cast one last vote Oct. 13 on a final zoning map. The new rules will go into effect on Jan. 1.
“Right now, Lakewood is an infill city and there’s not a lot of housing stock coming online,” Adams said. “The supply and demand effect is real. The core idea of this zoning update is that it allows more units to be built — it creates more units for people who are desperately looking for a house.”

Lakewood Mayor Wendi Strom said the overhaul had taken much of the council’s time in recent months. She remembers adjourning one council meeting just before 3 a.m. in September as its members dissected and analyzed dense zoning code documents deep into the night.
The process, she said, isn’t going to make everyone in the city happy.
“This is their home — these are the roofs over their heads,” Strom said. “And it can be concerning what’s happening on the lot next to yours.”
But the mayor has also heard impassioned pleas from young families that just can’t crack the overinflated market. Supporting the development of more housing options will help those young families as well as older residents, teachers, firefighters and first-time homebuyers, she said.
“We have seen a level of concern from young people about the changes not being made,” Strom said. “Right now, we have way more demand than supply.”
According to the Lakewood Strategic Housing Plan, released in early 2024, planners estimated that the city would need at least 5,800 new homes built over the next 10 years to satisfy anticipated demand.
At the metro level, the Denver Regional Council of Governments concluded in a September 2024 report that an area encompassing slightly beyond the Denver area would need 216,000 new housing units — whether houses or apartments or other multifamily units — by 2032.
Fifty-two thousand of them would cover the current shortage, while 164,000 of that total represent new units needed in the future, DRCOG concluded.
Houses now larger — and more expensive
Max Nardo, a housing and smart growth senior associate with the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, said the status quo simply wasn’t working. His organization has been following the Lakewood code updates closely.
“Cities in Colorado are dealing with the same housing crisis, and many are looking at the same solutions — smaller homes on smaller lots,” he said.
Lakewood’s housing assessment report concluded that nearly three-quarters of households in the city had just one or two people. It also noted that the average single-family home built since 2000 had about 2,600 square feet of space — much larger than houses built decades earlier — and sold for more than $1.1 million.
“It’s a ridiculous mismatch with what the city really needs,” Nardo said.

But Lakewood has seen at least one major institutional protest to its plans. The Green Mountain Water and Sanitation District, which serves 10,000 accounts, accounting for 48,000 residents in Lakewood, wrote a letter to the city in August. It warned that “densification” of the city’s housing stock could compromise the district’s ability to provide adequate service.
Karen Morgan, the district’s president, told The Denver Post that the district had to plan for the long term.
“We are already overcapacity with our sewer pipes,” she said. “We do not have the infrastructure to handle that density, especially since we don’t know when it’s happening.”
A potential harbinger of what could emerge in the wake of Lakewood’s update might exist in Portland, Oregon, where city leaders undertook a similar effort to encourage denser residential construction a few years ago, Nardo said.
A review of outcomes from that initiative found that between August 2021 and June 2024, the city permitted more than 1,400 accessory dwelling units — which typically include garage apartments and granny flats — and middle housing units, which the report described as duplexes to cottage clusters. The most common middle housing unit built during that period in Portland was a two-bedroom home weighing in at a cozy 900 square feet.
Most notably, according to the report, the average sale price of one of those new market-rate middle housing units in 2023 and 2024 was about $250,000 less than the price of a new single-family detached house.
Adams, the new homeowner in Lakewood, said today’s housing market is far different from what it was when many homeowners who are wary about the city’s initiative bought their properties.
“They bought in at a time when it was more affordable, and they are scared that it’s going to change overnight,” he said. “But if they look at other places that have done this, it’s a slow process.”
That gives little comfort to folks like Hopkins, 40, who took a lead in opposing the construction of a five-story apartment complex on the edge of Belmar Park in recent years. That project, she feared, would ruin the feel of a natural oasis in the middle of Lakewood. The developer overcame that fight and is now proceeding toward construction.
“One of the reasons I oppose the code changes is that a neighborhood’s character will completely change,” she said. “They’re trying to urbanize and gentrify Lakewood. They are just trying to increase density.”
‘All that does is gentrify’
In Littleton, Joe Whitney says building more units won’t necessarily translate to lower home prices. Prices are struck on more than just the availability of housing stock, he says. They also depend on construction costs and what is profitable for the builder.
He points to a recently built triplex on South Sycamore Street that offered little price relief to those looking for a home in Littleton, despite the building offering more living units than the single-family homes surrounding it. According to online records from the Arapahoe County Assessor’s Office, the three attached units were purchased for between $980,000 and $1.15 million — prices well above the metro area median.
“All that does is gentrify — it doesn’t improve affordability,” Whitney said of the new construction. “The last thing we want to see is Littleton turn into Lakewood.”
Housing economists and advocates for more density point out that there’s more complexity at play in the housing market. They argue that the building of high-end units still reduces overall pressure on rents and housing prices as residents of lower-cost homes upgrade, moving out and making those older units available.
But the gentification concern is why Rooted in Littleton chose to try and preempt the city from doing what Harris called another “sneak attack” on the city’s residents. That’s the term he uses to characterize the contretemps that occurred in January, when the council abandoned an attempt to welcome denser housing types in the city after blowback from the community.
The ballot measure, if approved by voters next month, would keep the council from bringing other types of housing to single-family neighborhoods, which Harris said cover nearly half of Littleton’s land mass.
Nothing, however, would stop homeowners from requesting permission from the city to build nonconforming structures on their lot.
“We’re not trying to tie the hands of individual property owners — we’re trying to tie the hands of a City Council that just wants density,” he said.
Mail ballots for Littleton’s election will go out beginning Friday.
Peters, the Littleton councilwoman, worries about the fiscal impact on Littleton if the measure ends up passing. The governor, in August, signed an executive order that threatened to withhold grants from cities that refuse to follow the new state housing laws.
If Littleton’s hands are tied by the restrictions laid out in the ballot measure, Peters said, “it means we’ll be out of compliance with the state and ineligible for grant money.”
Colorado Municipal League Executive Director Kevin Bommer said what’s playing out today in Littleton and Lakewood strikes on a familiar theme, “especially when the pressure to grow comes head-to-head with the desire to preserve the character of a community.”
But Bommer, a vocal opponent of state interference in municipal decisions, said “these difficult conversations are happening exactly where they are supposed to be,” at the city level.
“Local control — or local decision-making — isn’t always pretty, but it is the best way to solve local challenges and talk about the future,” he said. “This is precisely how things need to happen.”

Bell County Gen Z,
Millennials struggle with homeownership dreams as 70% face housing affordability crisis
BROADCAST TRANSCRIPT:
Simon Kwan has been saving for a house for over a year, but like many in his generation, homeownership feels increasingly out of reach in Bell County.The 27-year-old father from Belton represents a growing trend affecting young adults across the region. According to Redfin, around 70% of Gen Z and millennials are struggling to afford housing, and that challenge is evident locally.""We've been working on saving up for a little over a year now but it's definitely not going as fast as we thought it would be,"" Kwan said.
Marc Monroy, KXXV
Even while living with his parents to reduce expenses, Kwan said rising costs across all categories make saving for a home deposit nearly impossible.""It's hard to save up with the prices of everything you know even living with my parents we still have to pay for our phone bill, insurance and car insurance,"" Kwan said. ""It's a little expensive right now.""Bobbie Perius, another Belton resident, faces similar financial pressures as a parent trying to build stability for her family.""Everything is expensive especially having kids and everything like groceries and rent,"" Perius said.
Marc Monroy, KXXV
When asked whether she thinks she'll ever be able to afford a home, Perius expressed cautious optimism.""I hope so,"" Perius said.The uncertainty extends beyond individual families to broader market concerns about future housing accessibility.""There is a lot of uncertainty with how the housing market is going to look like in a couple years,"" Kwan said.Despite the financial challenges and market uncertainty, Kwan remains hopeful about eventually achieving his dream of homeownership, even if it takes longer than he originally planned.This story was reported on-air by a journalist and has been converted to this platform with the assistance of AI.

2025-10-07 12:15:00,"Angelita Ellison, 42, splits housing expenses with her sister and pays about $900 per month for rent and utilities.Read moreElizabeth Robertson / Staff Photographerby Michaelle Bond and Lizzie Mulvey Published Oct. 13, 2025, 5:00 a.m. ETThe number of Philadelphians who spend more than a third of their income on rent is growing.Almost half of renters spent 35% or more on housing costs in 2024, a four percentage point increase over the previous year, according to Census Bureau data. It’s the only category of renters that grew by percentage.AdvertisementThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development calls any renter who spends more than 30% of their income “cost burdened.”Kadeem Morris, comanaging attorney of the housing unit at Community Legal Services of Philadelphia, a legal aid nonprofit, sees renters struggling with cost burdens every day.Recently, a man in his 70s asked for help after his landlord of two decades sold the property and the new owner said his rent would double to $1,200. The man receives about that much per month from the Social Security Administration and has been using half to pay his rent since his wife died six months ago. Now, he’ll need to find a new place to live.Morris said he’ll qualify for some help to pay his bills. “Still, a large chunk of his check will be going toward keeping himself housed. Hopefully, it’s not more than 60[%] to 70%, which is extremely high.”In 2024, more than 148,900 households in Philadelphia were spending 35% or more of their income to rent their homes. Cost-burdened households have less money to pay for other essentials such as food and healthcare and to save for emergencies and future goals.The Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University found that nationally, two-thirds of working-age renters don’t have enough money left over after paying rent to cover other necessities, according to a paper published last month. That’s more than the 50% of renters who are considered cost burdened under the traditional definition.“It’s definitely an all too common scenario that our seniors in particular are facing,” Morris said. Where many cost-burdened renters liveResearchers at Reinvestment Fund, a Philadelphia-based community investment nonprofit, have seen the highest increases in housing cost burdens across outer West Philadelphia, the Germantown area, upper North Philadelphia, and lower Northeast Philadelphia, said Emily Dowdall, president of policy solutions. That aligns with the latest Census Bureau data.In neighborhoods such as Hunting Park in North Philadelphia and Cobbs Creek in West Philadelphia, where residents largely have low to moderate incomes and are largely people of color, costs to rent or own are on the rise.The makeup of these neighborhoods has stayed roughly the same in recent years, which indicates that established communities haven’t been displaced with people who can pay more, but “the same people are now paying more for the same homes,” Dowdall said.A ‘balancing act’Seniors’ fixed incomes are “just not keeping up with the rental market,” said Rita Eichman, tenant rights staff attorney at the nonprofit SeniorLAW Center. “They have to stretch the little money they have. A lot of them are scraping by.”When they need grab bars or other modifications to make homes accessible, “a lot of times, seniors have to come out of their own pocket to make those updates for themselves,” she said.SeniorLAW Center helps connect older Philadelphians with resources, including food pantries and utility assistance programs. But renters can’t benefit from those programs when their names aren’t on the utility accounts, as often happens for water and gas, Eichman said.She often works with seniors who have little to no income or assets who are eligible to receive monthly payments through the Social Security Administration’s Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program. But the timing of payments depends on the recipient’s last name. So renters may not get paid by their rent deadline.“They’re in a situation where they’re constantly juggling their finances,” Eichman said. “It’s hard to convince a landlord, ‘Can they just pay you on the 15th?’”Fees for late rent can be costly. “Then that throws them totally off,” she said. “And it’s hard for them to come back from that.”Some of her clients have worked out deals with landlords to pay in two installments during the month, timed to SSI, pension, or other payments.“It is very much a balancing act,” Eichman said.Making it workMany renters share the rent burden by renting with friends and family.Angelita Ellison, her 19-year-old son, and her sister live in a rowhouse with three bedrooms and one bathroom in the Sharswood area of North Philadelphia.Ellison, 42, splits housing expenses with her sister and pays about $900 per month for rent and utilities.She recently got a raise, so before taxes, she makes a little less than $3,200 per month. But she has a seasonal job working for the state for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. So for about three months of the year, she relies on unemployment benefits. With housing costs, student loan payments, and other expenses, during those months, “I try to be strategic about what gets paid,” Ellison said.“Especially right when rent is due, it feels like I have the least amount of money,” she said.With her raise, she thinks she could move into a home with just her son, but her sister would struggle to afford her own place. And if Ellison had to pay $1,800 for housing costs herself, she’d be spending more than half her income.“It’s difficult for me,” she said, “but I feel like I’m in a much better position than a lot of other people.”Rising rentsRents in Philadelphia have risen for a variety of reasons.Some of the increase comes from inflation and the rising costs of owning and maintaining rental properties. Home values have jumped up across the city in recent years, so buyers of rental properties are paying more and charging tenants more to cover costs and make a profit.Homes in Philadelphia have appreciated more than 92% over the past 10 years, according to a Lindy Institute for Urban Innovation analysis of Federal Housing Finance Agency data. In the last year alone, home values have increased by 3.4%. Demand for rentals is high, so landlords can charge more. This summer, there were 10 prospective renters for each available apartment in Philadelphia, according to a report by RentCafe, a nationwide apartment search website. That’s up from eight renters a year ago.Some of the rent uptick comes from the city’s changing rental landscape.Philadelphia has historically been a place with a lot of small landlords who own a few homes or less. But since the pandemic, more larger-scale corporate investors have moved in, said Dowdall at Reinvestment Fund, “and they’ve become really interested in the lowest-cost housing stock.”These regional and national rental property owners profit when they buy homes for low prices and raise rents. Institutional investors, such as those associated with banks and private equity groups, are responsible for bringing in revenue for their shareholders.“Once you make housing a commodity, you’re gonna see those rents go up,” she said.Lagging incomesIn Philadelphia, low incomes are the main reason why people can’t afford homes — more than high housing prices.The average income of housing clients at Community Legal Services is about $13,000. Morris estimates that most are spending half of their income on housing costs.Monthly rent in Philadelphia increased from a median of $1,390 in 2023 to $1,500 in 2024, according to American Community Survey data. So last year, the typical renter had to pay about $1,320 more over a 12-month period.But annual incomes have decreased. The household median went from $62,100 in 2023 to $60,500 in 2024 after adjusting for inflation. And that’s the median, so half of households were making less.Pennsylvania’s minimum wage is one of the lowest in the country at $7.25. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology found in February that an hourly living wage for a one-person household in Pennsylvania was $22.91.“Raising that minimum would help a lot of people be better able to pay for basic things like housing, medical costs, etcetera,” Dowdall said.Some Philadelphians have incomes that just aren’t enough to cover housing costs, and the complex housing affordability problem requires a variety of solutions, she said.“It’s essential that we’re helping people raise their wages, that we’re helping people supplement their incomes with things like subsidies, and that we’re lowering the cost of housing,” she said.",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/personal-finance/article-toronto-montreal-vancouver-housing-costs-affordability-real-estate/,United States,39.828175,-98.5795,2,theglobeandmail.com

By John Aguilar | jaguilar@denverpost.com | The Denver PostPUBLISHED: October 5, 2025 at 6:00 AM MDT Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...Two suburban cities south and west of Denver find themselves on distinctly different tracks in addressing a long-vexing problem — the high prices and elevated borrowing costs that box out young families and renters of all ages from buying a home.
In Lakewood, elected leaders spent the summer overhauling the city’s zoning code and land use rules. Their goal: to encourage the building of more varied housing types, and by extension greater density, in the city of 156,000, with the ultimate aim of lowering overall home prices.
In Littleton, a similar pro-density effort had sparked a furious backlash earlier this year. Now a citizen-initiated measure is bound for the Nov. 4 ballot and, if passed, it will restrict a large chunk of the city from having anything but single-family homes — a stark pivot from city leaders’ prior goal.
Each city is part of a larger density debate that has played out in communities across metro Denver and has dominated housing affordability discussions at all levels, from the Colorado statehouse to neighborhood streets.
Littleton City Councilwoman Andrea Peters, who is also a real estate agent, said the lack of “missing middle” housing in her city is having a chain-reaction effect on younger families seeking their first home as well as older people looking to downsize. That type of housing includes duplexes, triplexes and attached townhomes, which are designed to house more people per square foot but are less imposing than hulking apartment buildings or condos.
“We have an aging demographic and we don’t have a plan for younger families,” Peters said. “If we have more smaller-size options (for downsizers), that frees up that larger home for someone else.”
Mark Harris, an eight-year resident of Littleton, is part of a group dubbed Rooted in Littleton that is behind Measure 3A on this fall’s ballot. He says the goal is to stop the city from shoehorning certain housing types into neighborhoods where they don’t fit and where residents don’t want them.

“Our intent is to preserve single-family land use — that’s what we’re trying to do,” he said. “We are not anti-growth. We are not anti-affordable housing. We just don’t want duplexes, triplexes and quadplexes imposed on us.”
As high-level discussions on affordability have taken up much of the oxygen in policy debates in recent years, the issue has been tackled in the state Capitol. A collection of bills passed in 2024 and signed into law by Gov. Jared Polis was designed to increase higher-density living and bring home prices down.
Several Front Range municipalities have, in turn, sued the state, claiming its mandate to implement zoning-related changes encroached on their home rule powers to set their own land-use rules.
And at the center of it all is raw emotion.
“This place doesn’t resemble what it used to be — not at all,” said Regina Hopkins, a lifelong Lakewood resident who feels the growth in her city over the last couple decades has been out of control. “Why are local governments being forced to fix what is a state issue?”
Hopkins, 40, and others in Lakewood are exploring whether to put their own measure on the ballot to roll back what the city is expected to finalize on Oct. 13.
But for newcomer Robert Adams, Lakewood is doing the right thing. At 39, he finally got out of the rental game by purchasing a 1,200-square-foot, 1950s-era home in the city.
“After my years of renting, we bought 2½ years ago — and it’s quite a burden to afford a moderately-priced home,” he said.
While home prices have finally stagnated across metro Denver in recent months, they haven’t come down much from their record levels. The median price gain of a residential property sold in August in metro Denver was 0.3% compared to the same month a year earlier, rising to $587,000, according to a recent report from Homes.com. That was below the 2.4% annual price gain seen nationally, the site said.
In August 2021, when values were surging, metro Denver home prices rose 17.4% compared to a year earlier.
While some experts say the local housing scene has flipped to a buyer’s market, high mortgage rates are keeping things tough for those on the hunt for a listing. Adams paid $650,000 for his Lakewood house, and he carries a 6.6% interest rate on his loan.
“We can manage it, but just barely,” he said.
Need for ‘missing middle’ housing
The Lakewood City Council has already approved three rounds of updates to the city’s zoning code. Those include measures allowing diverse housing stock anywhere in the city, limiting new home sizes to 5,000 square feet, and encouraging the conversion of vacant or underused commercial buildings to housing.
Council members will cast one last vote Oct. 13 on a final zoning map. The new rules will go into effect on Jan. 1.
“Right now, Lakewood is an infill city and there’s not a lot of housing stock coming online,” Adams said. “The supply and demand effect is real. The core idea of this zoning update is that it allows more units to be built — it creates more units for people who are desperately looking for a house.”

Lakewood Mayor Wendi Strom said the overhaul had taken much of the council’s time in recent months. She remembers adjourning one council meeting just before 3 a.m. in September as its members dissected and analyzed dense zoning code documents deep into the night.
The process, she said, isn’t going to make everyone in the city happy.
“This is their home — these are the roofs over their heads,” Strom said. “And it can be concerning what’s happening on the lot next to yours.”
But the mayor has also heard impassioned pleas from young families that just can’t crack the overinflated market. Supporting the development of more housing options will help those young families as well as older residents, teachers, firefighters and first-time homebuyers, she said.
“We have seen a level of concern from young people about the changes not being made,” Strom said. “Right now, we have way more demand than supply.”
According to the Lakewood Strategic Housing Plan, released in early 2024, planners estimated that the city would need at least 5,800 new homes built over the next 10 years to satisfy anticipated demand.
At the metro level, the Denver Regional Council of Governments concluded in a September 2024 report that an area encompassing slightly beyond the Denver area would need 216,000 new housing units — whether houses or apartments or other multifamily units — by 2032.
Fifty-two thousand of them would cover the current shortage, while 164,000 of that total represent new units needed in the future, DRCOG concluded.
Houses now larger — and more expensive
Max Nardo, a housing and smart growth senior associate with the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, said the status quo simply wasn’t working. His organization has been following the Lakewood code updates closely.
“Cities in Colorado are dealing with the same housing crisis, and many are looking at the same solutions — smaller homes on smaller lots,” he said.
Lakewood’s housing assessment report concluded that nearly three-quarters of households in the city had just one or two people. It also noted that the average single-family home built since 2000 had about 2,600 square feet of space — much larger than houses built decades earlier — and sold for more than $1.1 million.
“It’s a ridiculous mismatch with what the city really needs,” Nardo said.

But Lakewood has seen at least one major institutional protest to its plans. The Green Mountain Water and Sanitation District, which serves 10,000 accounts, accounting for 48,000 residents in Lakewood, wrote a letter to the city in August. It warned that “densification” of the city’s housing stock could compromise the district’s ability to provide adequate service.
Karen Morgan, the district’s president, told The Denver Post that the district had to plan for the long term.
“We are already overcapacity with our sewer pipes,” she said. “We do not have the infrastructure to handle that density, especially since we don’t know when it’s happening.”
A potential harbinger of what could emerge in the wake of Lakewood’s update might exist in Portland, Oregon, where city leaders undertook a similar effort to encourage denser residential construction a few years ago, Nardo said.
A review of outcomes from that initiative found that between August 2021 and June 2024, the city permitted more than 1,400 accessory dwelling units — which typically include garage apartments and granny flats — and middle housing units, which the report described as duplexes to cottage clusters. The most common middle housing unit built during that period in Portland was a two-bedroom home weighing in at a cozy 900 square feet.

Most notably, according to the report, the average sale price of one of those new market-rate middle housing units in 2023 and 2024 was about $250,000 less than the price of a new single-family detached house.
Adams, the new homeowner in Lakewood, said today’s housing market is far different from what it was when many homeowners who are wary about the city’s initiative bought their properties.
“They bought in at a time when it was more affordable, and they are scared that it’s going to change overnight,” he said. “But if they look at other places that have done this, it’s a slow process.”
That gives little comfort to folks like Hopkins, 40, who took a lead in opposing the construction of a five-story apartment complex on the edge of Belmar Park in recent years.

“One of the reasons I oppose the code changes is that a neighborhood’s character will completely change,” she said. “They’re trying to urbanize and gentrify Lakewood. They are just trying to increase density.”
‘All that does is gentrify’
In Littleton, Joe Whitney says building more units won’t necessarily translate to lower home prices. Prices are struck on more than just the availability of housing stock, he says. They also depend on construction costs and what is profitable for the builder.
He points to a recently built triplex on South Sycamore Street that offered little price relief to those looking for a home in Littleton, despite the building offering more living units than the single-family homes surrounding it. According to online records from the Arapahoe County Assessor’s Office, the three attached units were purchased for between $980,000 and $1.15 million — prices well above the metro area median.
“All that does is gentrify — it doesn’t improve affordability,” Whitney said of the new construction. “The last thing we want to see is Littleton turn into Lakewood.”
Housing economists and advocates for more density point out that there’s more complexity at play in the housing market. They argue that the building of high-end units still reduces overall pressure on rents and housing prices as residents of lower-cost homes upgrade, moving out and making those older units available.
But the gentification concern is why Rooted in Littleton chose to try and preempt the city from doing what Harris called another “sneak attack” on the city’s residents. That’s the term he uses to characterize the contretemps that occurred in January, when the council abandoned an attempt to welcome denser housing types in the city after blowback from the community.
The ballot measure, if approved by voters next month, would keep the council from bringing other types of housing to single-family neighborhoods, which Harris said cover nearly half of Littleton’s land mass.
Nothing, however, would stop homeowners from requesting permission from the city to build nonconforming structures on their lot.
“We’re not trying to tie the hands of individual property owners — we’re trying to tie the hands of a City Council that just wants density,” he said.
Mail ballots for Littleton’s election will go out beginning Friday.
Peters, the Littleton councilwoman, worries about the fiscal impact on Littleton if the measure ends up passing. The governor, in August, signed an executive order that threatened to withhold grants from cities that refuse to follow the new state housing laws.
If Littleton’s hands are tied by the restrictions laid out in the ballot measure, Peters said, “it means we’ll be out of compliance with the state and ineligible for grant money.”
Colorado Municipal League Executive Director Kevin Bommer said what’s playing out today in Littleton and Lakewood strikes on a familiar theme, “especially when the pressure to grow comes head-to-head with the desire to preserve the character of a community.”
But Bommer, a vocal opponent of state interference in municipal decisions, said “these difficult conversations are happening exactly where they are supposed to be,” at the city level.
“Local control — or local decision-making — isn’t always pretty, but it is the best way to solve local challenges and talk about the future,” he said. “This is precisely how things need to happen.”

The housing crisis is felt most acutely by low- and moderate-income families. When possible, we want to address these families’ needs directly by creating housing they can afford. Many are working on it; it is possible — and it is very expensive.We need to use every tool available to help us move us towards greater housing affordability.One tool is to build more housing at every level, including the higher-end. In fact, a 2024 study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis showed that, in their housing market, for every unit of market-rate housing built, 0.6 units of affordable housing are made available. This is remarkable. Let developers build luxury housing on their dime, and for every five homes they build, the city gets three affordable homes, essentially for free.How does this work? First of all, higher-end housing is relatively easy to create because it can be sold for at least whatever it costs to build, significantly reducing the challenges of funding the project. As we’ve discussed in previous columns, the town and county’s land use codes, like land use codes around the country, also make it fairly easy to build higher-end, single family homes.The housing market is interconnected. A wealthy person looking for a home in Taos (or a second home, but more on that later) is probably looking for something newer and nicer. However, if there is not enough housing supply and they can’t find something higher-end, they will move into a middle-income home. They will move into the home you want to live in, except they will be able to pay more than you.I’ve spoken with someone in Taos earning a six-figure salary who was unable to find a suitable home, for example. As a result, they were renting a casita, a home that absolutely could have been available to a more moderate income household if this person had found the housing they needed.When housing supply is limited, wealthier people will almost always come out on top because they can afford to pay whatever it takes. When housing supply is limited, it’s lower income households who lose.If we build housing at every level, including higher end housing, wealthy people will live in those homes, and some will move out of their more middle-income homes into a new luxury home, freeing up their home for a middle-income family, and on it goes.This process is known in housing economics as ""filtering"" and has been observed and measured in actual markets across the country. It is also sometimes called a housing ladder: If there isn’t room on every rung, there is no place for people to move. However, like all economic concepts, it requires considering some nuance.One major issue with the efficacy of filtering in a market like Taos is second homes or vacation rentals: We don’t gain new units of housing if the supply is dominated by these uses.This column is all about what we can actually do to increase housing affordability. Can we limit the number of homes in Taos used as vacation or short term rentals? Yes and no. The town and county have taken steps to cap the number of short term rentals, which hopefully will ensure that more of our limited housing stock goes to people who actually live here.However, there is not much we can do right now about second homeowners. The Town of Taos and Taos County cannot legally restrict them or tax them. The state Legislature has tried to figure out a way to tax second homeowners, but has found the technicalities of determining how to figure out what is a “second home” versus what is generational property, for example, to be prohibitively difficult. Stay tuned. If they can crack that code, it might return to the Legislature in future years.Above I also mentioned the impressive rates of filtering in Minneapolis, but the effect of filtering is not as robust in all markets. In New York City it’s closer to 0.2 affordable homes for every market-rate home built, which still has a real if lesser impact on housing affordability. We don’t have data on what the filtering rates are in Taos, but the rates are likely to be closer to NYC’s due to the vacation rental/second home demand.The filtering process will work better in Taos the more we build. That’s why we need to continue to advocate for removing zoning barriers and say “yes” to all types of housing in our community.Building higher income housing is not going to solve Taos’ housing affordability woes. We need to prioritize creating and preserving the housing that lower and moderate income families in Taos can actually afford. And while we work towards those goals, a slow but steady process, why not let the market shoulder some more of the load? Building housing at every level is one piece of the puzzle that can make Taos more affordable.

2025-10-05 15:30:00,"Home affordability in the United States has reached its best level in two and a half years, helped by falling mortgage rates, according to data released on Monday from ICE Mortgage Technology.
The company’s October 2025 Mortgage Monitor report found that 30-year mortgage rates averaged 6.26% in mid-September, lowering the monthly principal and interest payment on an average-priced home to $2,148. That equals 30% of the median U.S. household income, down from 32% earlier this summer and well below the 35% peak in late 2023.
The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rate by a quarter point on Sept. 17, 2025, pushing the 10-year Treasury yield to a five-month low ahead of the decision. Mortgage rates briefly dipped to 6.22%, their lowest in nearly a year, before rebounding, while spreads over Treasuries narrowed to their tightest since early 2022.
Markets now expect 30-year mortgage rates to hover near 6.25% by year’s end and 6.15% by early 2026, giving room for improved homebuyer affordability and buyer loan qualification.
“The recent pullback in rates has created a tailwind for both homebuyers and existing borrowers,” said Andy Walden, head of mortgage and housing market research at ICE. “We’re seeing affordability at a 2.5-year high, which is beginning to bolster purchase demand, while creating more opportunities for homeowners to lower their monthly payments with a rate-and-term refinance loan.”
While affordability has improved, the report noted sharp disparities across markets. About a dozen of the 100 largest housing markets — many in the Midwest — are nearing long-term average affordability levels.
“As affordability improves and homeowners gain the ability to refinance, lenders and servicers need to be ready to act quickly,” said Tim Bowler, president of ICE Mortgage Technology.
Coastal cities, however, remain stretched; in Los Angeles, 62% of the median income is needed to buy an average-priced home.
Mortgage delinquencies usually see little seasonal change between July and August, but the month ended on a Sunday in 2025, pushing some last-day payments into September and creating a temporary uptick, the company reported. The national delinquency rate rose by 16 basis points in August to 3.43% and is up 10 basis points from the same time last year.
The report also found that home prices firmed in September after eight months of slowing, with annual price growth up 1.2%. Tighter inventory and improved affordability supported the gains, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest.
Nationally, listings remain about 18% below 2017–2019 norms, as sellers in previously oversupplied markets hold back to avoid price cuts.
In September, 80% of markets saw price increases, the highest share in nine months, while just 20% declined, down from more than half in July. Still, nearly half of the major markets remain below recent peaks.
Borrower profiles also point to improved financial stability. The average credit score for purchase locks climbed above 736, the highest in the six-year history of ICE’s dataset, while debt-to-income ratios for purchase loans fell to a 2.5-year low of 38.5%.
For rate-and-term refinances, debt-to-income ratios dropped to 34.1%, the lowest in 3.5 years.

Gov. Wes Moore signed an executive order on Sept. 3 aimed at tackling Maryland’s escalating housing affordability crisis. The Housing Starts Here initiative seeks to expedite housing development, reduce production delays and make home ownership more accessible across the state.

According to the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), the state faces a deficit of around 96,000 housing units – a gap that has been widening over recent years.  
The 2025 Maryland Housing Needs Assessment, an analysis of Maryland’s housing gap conducted by DHCD and The National Center for Smart Growth, reveals significant disparities in housing availability across the state. Counties like Montgomery and Howard have median home prices exceeding $600,000, making homeownership unattainable for low- and middle-income residents.  
Conversely, areas such as Allegany and Wicomico counties report median home prices below $200,000, which indicates regional inconsistencies in the Maryland housing market.

The executive order will broadly target each county in Maryland in order to create more housing development throughout the state.  

“ says that everybody has a piece of the housing crisis, and everybody deserves for their local and state governments to be working in concert to solve that crisis,” DHCD Secretary Jake Day said.  
In more than half of Maryland counties, renters are spending more than one-third of their annual income on housing costs, which is considered unaffordable by federal standards.  
While Maryland’s median income is 28 percent higher than the national median, the state’s median home price is 35 percent higher, highlighting the disproportionate cost of housing.  
“How we got here is really the post-2008 financial crisis. It was real-estate driven… that had to do with risks that the financial industry took at the time,” Secretary Day said. “It led to a collapse in the economy, in residential home values and more. The over-correction of the market meant we stopped building houses at a pace that matched population growth.”

The Housing Starts Here Executive Order directs state agencies to identify underutilized state-owned properties suitable for transit-oriented development, aiming to increase housing density in areas with existing infrastructure.  
Transit-oriented development is a strategy that promotes dense, mixed-use communities around transit to help increase ridership and the use of public transportation.  
“There are a lot of benefits to it… . We want to develop state-owned land for transit-oriented development, since state-owned land is not currently taxable. There’s no revenue generation for the states or local jurisdictions. It also provides an opportunity for Marylanders to live closer to transit and use it more,” Maryland Department of Transportation’s Chief of Real Estate and Transit-Oriented Development David Zaidain said. 
According to Zaidain, transportation is the second biggest household budget item behind housing. It costs roughly $600 a month for Marylanders to own a car, which is pushing the state towards more transit usage.  

Zaidain also noted the climate change benefits that come with transit-oriented development.  
The executive order directs the state to speed up timelines for housing permits and establish a state housing ombudsman, or overseer, to help projects move forward.  
The legislation comes on the heels of a 2024 legislative package that made housing more affordable and accessible for Marylanders struggling with construction barriers, along with creating the Office of Tenant and Landlord Affairs.

The Housing Starts Here order also directs agencies to track housing production progress annually, coordinate with local governments to address regional shortages and ensure accountability across jurisdictions.  

By centralizing oversight and removing barriers, the administration aims to close the housing deficit and expand affordable options for Marylanders in the years ahead.  
“When regulatory processes add cost, that cost has to be recouped – either with higher rents or a higher sales price. So, the more regulatory burden we place, the more likely it is that we’re just producing expensive for people to live,” Secretary Day said. “By cutting time and money out of the process, by streamlining it, we can make it easier to get to the finish line.”

Two Denver suburbs take different paths as residents face housing crunch: ‘We can manage it, but just barely’

By John Aguilar | jaguilar@denverpost.com | The Denver PostPUBLISHED: October 5, 2025 at 6:00 AM MDT Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...Two suburban cities south and west of Denver find themselves on distinctly different tracks in addressing a long-vexing problem — the high prices and elevated borrowing costs that box out young families and renters of all ages from buying a home.
In Lakewood, elected leaders spent the summer overhauling the city’s zoning code and land use rules. Their goal: to encourage the building of more varied housing types, and by extension greater density, in the city of 156,000, with the ultimate aim of lowering overall home prices.
In Littleton, a similar pro-density effort had sparked a furious backlash earlier this year. Now a citizen-initiated measure is bound for the Nov. 4 ballot and, if passed, it will restrict a large chunk of the city from having anything but single-family homes — a stark pivot from city leaders’ prior goal.
Each city is part of a larger density debate that has played out in communities across metro Denver and has dominated housing affordability discussions at all levels, from the Colorado statehouse to neighborhood streets.
Littleton City Councilwoman Andrea Peters, who is also a real estate agent, said the lack of “missing middle” housing in her city is having a chain-reaction effect on younger families seeking their first home as well as older people looking to downsize. That type of housing includes duplexes, triplexes and attached townhomes, which are designed to house more people per square foot but are less imposing than hulking apartment buildings or condos.
“We have an aging demographic and we don’t have a plan for younger families,” Peters said. “If we have more smaller-size options (for downsizers), that frees up that larger home for someone else.”
Mark Harris, an eight-year resident of Littleton, is part of a group dubbed Rooted in Littleton that is behind Measure 3A on this fall’s ballot. He says the goal is to stop the city from shoehorning certain housing types into neighborhoods where they don’t fit and where residents don’t want them.

“Our intent is to preserve single-family land use — that’s what we’re trying to do,” he said. “We are not anti-growth. We are not anti-affordable housing. We just don’t want duplexes, triplexes and quadplexes imposed on us.”
As high-level discussions on affordability have taken up much of the oxygen in policy debates in recent years, the issue has been tackled in the state Capitol. A collection of bills passed in 2024 and signed into law by Gov. Jared Polis was designed to increase higher-density living and bring home prices down.
Several Front Range municipalities have, in turn, sued the state, claiming its mandate to implement zoning-related changes encroached on their home rule powers to set their own land-use rules.
And at the center of it all is raw emotion.
“This place doesn’t resemble what it used to be — not at all,” said Regina Hopkins, a lifelong Lakewood resident who feels the growth in her city over the last couple decades has been out of control. “Why are local governments being forced to fix what is a state issue?”
Hopkins, 40, and others in Lakewood are exploring whether to put their own measure on the ballot to roll back what the city is expected to finalize on Oct. 13.
But for newcomer Robert Adams, Lakewood is doing the right thing. At 39, he finally got out of the rental game by purchasing a 1,200-square-foot, 1950s-era home in the city.
“After my years of renting, we bought 2½ years ago — and it’s quite a burden to afford a moderately-priced home,” he said.
While home prices have finally stagnated across metro Denver in recent months, they haven’t come down much from their record levels. The median price gain of a residential property sold in August in metro Denver was 0.3% compared to the same month a year earlier, rising to $587,000, according to a recent report from Homes.com. That was below the 2.4% annual price gain seen nationally, the site said.
In August 2021, when values were surging, metro Denver home prices rose 17.4% compared to a year earlier.
While some experts say the local housing scene has flipped to a buyer’s market, high mortgage rates are keeping things tough for those on the hunt for a listing. Adams paid $650,000 for his Lakewood house, and he carries a 6.6% interest rate on his loan.
“We can manage it, but just barely,” he said.
Need for ‘missing middle’ housing
The Lakewood City Council has already approved three rounds of updates to the city’s zoning code. Those include measures allowing diverse housing stock anywhere in the city, limiting new home sizes to 5,000 square feet, and encouraging the conversion of vacant or underused commercial buildings to housing.
Council members will cast one last vote Oct. 13 on a final zoning map. The new rules will go into effect on Jan. 1.
“Right now, Lakewood is an infill city and there’s not a lot of housing stock coming online,” Adams said. “The supply and demand effect is real. The core idea of this zoning update is that it allows more units to be built — it creates more units for people who are desperately looking for a house.”

Lakewood Mayor Wendi Strom said the overhaul had taken much of the council’s time in recent months. She remembers adjourning one council meeting just before 3 a.m. in September as its members dissected and analyzed dense zoning code documents deep into the night.
The process, she said, isn’t going to make everyone in the city happy.
“This is their home — these are the roofs over their heads,” Strom said. “And it can be concerning what’s happening on the lot next to yours.”
But the mayor has also heard impassioned pleas from young families that just can’t crack the overinflated market. Supporting the development of more housing options will help those young families as well as older residents, teachers, firefighters and first-time homebuyers, she said.
“We have seen a level of concern from young people about the changes not being made,” Strom said. “Right now, we have way more demand than supply.”
According to the Lakewood Strategic Housing Plan, released in early 2024, planners estimated that the city would need at least 5,800 new homes built over the next 10 years to satisfy anticipated demand.
At the metro level, the Denver Regional Council of Governments concluded in a September 2024 report that an area encompassing slightly beyond the Denver area would need 216,000 new housing units — whether houses or apartments or other multifamily units — by 2032.
Fifty-two thousand of them would cover the current shortage, while 164,000 of that total represent new units needed in the future, DRCOG concluded.
Houses now larger — and more expensive
Max Nardo, a housing and smart growth senior associate with the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, said the status quo simply wasn’t working. His organization has been following the Lakewood code updates closely.
“Cities in Colorado are dealing with the same housing crisis, and many are looking at the same solutions — smaller homes on smaller lots,” he said.
Lakewood’s housing assessment report concluded that nearly three-quarters of households in the city had just one or two people. It also noted that the average single-family home built since 2000 had about 2,600 square feet of space — much larger than houses built decades earlier — and sold for more than $1.1 million.
“It’s a ridiculous mismatch with what the city really needs,” Nardo said.

But Lakewood has seen at least one major institutional protest to its plans. The Green Mountain Water and Sanitation District, which serves 10,000 accounts, accounting for 48,000 residents in Lakewood, wrote a letter to the city in August. It warned that “densification” of the city’s housing stock could compromise the district’s ability to provide adequate service.
Karen Morgan, the district’s president, told The Denver Post that the district had to plan for the long term.
“We are already overcapacity with our sewer pipes,” she said. “We do not have the infrastructure to handle that density, especially since we don’t know when it’s happening.”
A potential harbinger of what could emerge in the wake of Lakewood’s update might exist in Portland, Oregon, where city leaders undertook a similar effort to encourage denser residential construction a few years ago, Nardo said.
A review of outcomes from that initiative found that between August 2021 and June 2024, the city permitted more than 1,400 accessory dwelling units — which typically include garage apartments and granny flats — and middle housing units, which the report described as duplexes to cottage clusters. The most common middle housing unit built during that period in Portland was a two-bedroom home weighing in at a cozy 900 square feet.
Most notably, according to the report, the average sale price of one of those new market-rate middle housing units in 2023 and 2024 was about $250,000 less than the price of a new single-family detached house.
Adams, the new homeowner in Lakewood, said today’s housing market is far different from what it was when many homeowners who are wary about the city’s initiative bought their properties.
“They bought in at a time when it was more affordable, and they are scared that it’s going to change overnight,” he said. “But if they look at other places that have done this, it’s a slow process.”
That gives little comfort to folks like Hopkins, 40, who took a lead in opposing the construction of a five-story apartment complex on the edge of Belmar Park in recent years. That project, she feared, would ruin the feel of a natural oasis in the middle of Lakewood. The developer overcame that fight and is now proceeding toward construction.
“One of the reasons I oppose the code changes is that a neighborhood’s character will completely change,” she said. “They’re trying to urbanize and gentrify Lakewood. They are just trying to increase density.”
‘All that does is gentrify’
In Littleton, Joe Whitney says building more units won’t necessarily translate to lower home prices. Prices are struck on more than just the availability of housing stock, he says. They also depend on construction costs and what is profitable for the builder.
He points to a recently built triplex on South Sycamore Street that offered little price relief to those looking for a home in Littleton, despite the building offering more living units than the single-family homes surrounding it. According to online records from the Arapahoe County Assessor’s Office, the three attached units were purchased for between $980,000 and $1.15 million — prices well above the metro area median.
“All that does is gentrify — it doesn’t improve affordability,” Whitney said of the new construction. “The last thing we want to see is Littleton turn into Lakewood.”
Housing economists and advocates for more density point out that there’s more complexity at play in the housing market. They argue that the building of high-end units still reduces overall pressure on rents and housing prices as residents of lower-cost homes upgrade, moving out and making those older units available.
But the gentification concern is why Rooted in Littleton chose to try and preempt the city from doing what Harris called another “sneak attack” on the city’s residents. That’s the term he uses to characterize the contretemps that occurred in January, when the council abandoned an attempt to welcome denser housing types in the city after blowback from the community.
The ballot measure, if approved by voters next month, would keep the council from bringing other types of housing to single-family neighborhoods, which Harris said cover nearly half of Littleton’s land mass.
Nothing, however, would stop homeowners from requesting permission from the city to build nonconforming structures on their lot.
“We’re not trying to tie the hands of individual property owners — we’re trying to tie the hands of a City Council that just wants density,” he said.
Mail ballots for Littleton’s election will go out beginning Friday.
Peters, the Littleton councilwoman, worries about the fiscal impact on Littleton if the measure ends up passing. The governor, in August, signed an executive order that threatened to withhold grants from cities that refuse to follow the new state housing laws.
If Littleton’s hands are tied by the restrictions laid out in the ballot measure, Peters said, “it means we’ll be out of compliance with the state and ineligible for grant money.”
Colorado Municipal League Executive Director Kevin Bommer said what’s playing out today in Littleton and Lakewood strikes on a familiar theme, “especially when the pressure to grow comes head-to-head with the desire to preserve the character of a community.”
But Bommer, a vocal opponent of state interference in municipal decisions, said “these difficult conversations are happening exactly where they are supposed to be,” at the city level.
“Local control — or local decision-making — isn’t always pretty, but it is the best way to solve local challenges and talk about the future,” he said. “This is precisely how things need to happen.”

Housing Affordability? Build, Baby, Build

Plain and simple (if not so easy politically): The cure for America’s housing crisis isn’t government subsidies or corporate scapegoats. It’s more homes. And this “supply and demand” solution isn’t being offered only by the new “abundance” advocates of the center left. Tobias Peter of the AEI Housing Center and economists at Goldman Sachs have both recently argued that affordability has collapsed because supply hasn’t kept up. Until policymakers face that basic, Econ 101 reality, prices and rents will remain out of reach.

In a recent podcast chat with me, Peter traces today’s housing crunch to a century of misguided rules and insular local politics. Zoning laws that restricted much land to single-family use, NIMBY activism that blocked projects, and environmental reviews that layered on costs have all constrained supply. Regulations now add about a quarter to the cost of a single-family home. 

While economics-averse critics blame institutional landlords, Peter dismisses that explanation as a distraction: Big investors own just one percent of single-family homes nationwide, never more than 10 percent in any county. The real imbalance, he says, is that years of policy choices have made it “easy to build small apartments for singles, but hard to build townhomes or modest houses for families.” His prescription is straightforward: Simplify rules, shrink minimum lot sizes, and reduce discretionary veto power. Had those reforms been in place since 2000, he estimates, the US would have nine million more homes today.

Goldman Sachs reaches similar conclusions in a new report, “The State of Housing (Un)Affordability in the US.” The bank quantifies just how badly affordability has deteriorated this decade. The typical mortgage payment has jumped from less than 20 percent of income before the pandemic to more than 30 percent since 2022, “a historically high ratio.” Also: “While affordability is less of a problem in the rental market, the rent-to-income ratio is now at its highest level since 1980.”

In addition, Goldman estimates the national housing shortage at roughly three to four million units, equal to two to three percent of the current housing stock. Among specific states, California and Florida face the largest deficits. The GS analysts attribute the gaps to a “sharp slowdown” in supply growth after the 2007–09 Great Recession, which left vacancy rates well below the norms of the two prior decades.

Many of the bank’s explanations echo Peter’s:

Restrictive zoning rules. Most US cities limit housing with height caps, large minimum lot sizes, and strict occupancy limits. Regulations have tightened over decades, and because rules are set by thousands of small towns and cities, reforms are hard to scale. 
Shrinking supply of buildable land. Empty, developable land is running out. In big metros, remaining land is mostly at the edges, where long commutes make building less practical.
Falling construction productivity and worker shortages. The construction industry has become less efficient over the last half-century, while a lack of skilled workers slows down projects, especially apartments. 
Weaker supply response to higher prices. Housing markets are less elastic than before. Price increases now trigger far smaller boosts in new supply than in past decades.                                                       

Goldman simulations suggest that reducing regulation to the level of the least restrictive metros could add 2.5 million units over the next decade, eliminating two-thirds of the shortage. Yet history shows reforms often fall short: 

While a large-scale reform could help to alleviate the housing shortage, implementing one would be challenging. Many land use reforms that were proposed by housing policy advocates and local governments over the past decade were rejected by local communities. A few reforms that were eventually passed affected only a small fraction of the land in the targeted cities.[7] As Exhibit 12 shows, academic studies found that these reforms led to only incremental increases in the housing supply that were not large enough to offset a rapid increase in local demand.

Besides land use reforms, federal and local governments have also tried other policies to alleviate the affordability issue, such as providing tax credits for the construction of affordable housing or setting a cap on rents for certain segments of the housing market. The academic studies reported in Exhibit 12 found that these policies indeed helped to reduce housing costs for lower-income households, but some of them also crowded out other housing investments and were costly to implement. 

Both Peter and Goldman Sachs—and the abundance folks—agree: The only real fix is building more of the right homes, faster.

Conor Sen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. He is founder of Peachtree Creek Investments.There’s good news and bad news on the housing front: The buyers’ strike of the past three years is finally working, but the path to better affordability looks painful for many of those trying to sell a home, the construction industry and, ultimately, the U.S. economy.When mortgage rates surged in 2022, it became clear that there was a shortage of housing available for buyers and renters alike, and that the rise in prices and interest rates left housing less affordable than it had been in decades. The silver lining for home builders was the opportunity the shortage represented. Prices stayed high and they kept building, supporting employment and economic activity.Fast forward to today and it’s hard to say that there’s a national housing shortage anymore. The National Association of Realtors’ gauge for months of supply of existing homes for sale is near the highest in nine years. There are now more completed new homes on the market than at any time in the past 16 years. And there are more vacant rental units around than before the pandemic, according to online marketplace Apartment List.Active housing inventory for sale is above 2019 levels in 14 states, spread mostly across the South and West, and including the important home-building states of Florida, Texas, Tennessee, Arizona and Colorado, according to Lance Lambert of ResiClub, a housing analytics site.

2025-10-05 12:45:00,"Alabama’s housing market is splitting. Lower-priced homes are selling briskly, while higher-end listings linger, according to the latest HW Data.
Affordable homes fuel pending sales
Alabama’s entry-level homes are moving quickly. The state recorded 1,843 pending sales in its most affordable tier last week at a median price of $165,000 — well below the national entry-level median of $215,000. These lower-priced homes went under contract in a median of 42 days, a week faster than Alabama’s overall pending average of 49 days.
Active inventory builds as higher-end homes linger
Across all price ranges, Alabama had 16,275 active single-family real estate listings last week with a median list price of $333,400. Homes still on the market carried a median age of 84 days, highlighting how higher-priced properties are moving more slowly.
Pending sales data reflects how quickly homes go under contract, while listings data shows the age of inventory still on the market. Together, they highlight both buyer activity and seller challenges.
The Altos Market Action Index registered 33, a level that generally favors sellers. The index compares the current rate of sales to available inventory, with 30 considered a balanced market. Higher numbers tilt toward sellers, while lower numbers tilt toward buyers. Still, Alabama’s longer listing times at higher price points suggest the seller’s edge isn’t universal.
A divided market
The data points to two different realities. Budget-conscious buyers are driving activity in affordable segments, where homes sell faster and at lower prices. Sellers above the median price are facing longer timelines and more competition, often needing more attractive pricing to secure offers.
What’s next
Alabama’s housing market remains resilient, but the divide is widening. Affordable homes continue to sell quickly, while higher-end properties test seller patience.
Nationally, the same pattern is emerging as affordable homes drive demand while pricier listings cool. Alabama’s numbers mirror that divide, showing continued strength in affordable segments and slower movement at the higher end.

2025-10-05 09:30:00,"As a new NAMB president takes office, his suggestions for helping solve the affordability crisis
By
Matt Sexton
06 Oct 2025
Share
The last time Kimber White became president of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers (NAMB), a global pandemic forced him to recalibrate his goals to deal with an unprecedented situation.
This time, as White (pictured top) takes over as NAMB president, he will be able to implement his agenda without COVID-19 getting in the way. That doesn’t mean there aren’t pressing issues for him to deal with.
One of the pressing issues that mortgage brokers nationwide face is the challenge of housing affordability. All buyers are struggling, but the issue is especially damaging to low-income and first-time homebuyers.
White hopes to have conversations at the congressional and Federal Housing levels to help improve affordability. One area where these conversations can begin is with loan-level price adjustments (LLPAs). This is where additional charges are added to a loan based on a borrower’s credit score, loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, property type, occupancy status, and loan purpose.
“The last FHFA Director said to me when we met face to face, ‘Oh, we're doing these loan-level price adjustments because investors and these second home people, they have to have skin in the game, to make skin in the game,’” White told Mortgage Professional America. “What you did was take the ability of that first-time buyer and of that second home buyer, which is that mom and pop who worked all of their lives to buy a retirement home out of their hands.
“You've actually made your housing issues worse by doing what you did by adding those loan-level pricing adjustments to second homes and investments. All you did was strip it out of the average middle working class, the small, independent person, and you put it in the hands of corporate America, making the housing crisis worse.”
Changes to LLPAs
He also noted that because of the way LLPAs are charged, the average working American who makes more than 80% of the area median income (AMI) with a higher credit score actually pays more fees.
“The other thing they can do is, if you make more than 80% of the AMI and your credit score is above a certain amount, you're penalized versus someone who has a lower credit score and is 80% under AMI,” White said. “You're basically penalizing the average group of working Americans with the loan level price adjustments, which I call another consumer tax. Just get rid of that.”
For White, it’s not enough for the government to declare a housing emergency. It comes down to actually finding solutions that can make housing more affordable for everyone.
“I want to be a part of that conversation,” he said. “That's why I'm hoping that we have our lobbyists and make sure that when they start talking and all the programs that are coming out, that we're not just declaring something that's a crisis. Hell, we all know it's a crisis. I'm a firm believer that I want to find solutions, and not everything will work, and the government works slowly. At least start taking baby steps and finding solutions that make sense.”
While he would like to see LLPAs go away completely, even a reduction could significantly improve affordability.
“I'd love to see them get rid of it totally,” he said. “I'd love to see that happen. But reduce it some. You can spur the economy by reducing some of the LLPA and the revenue that you're going to lose, you're going to make it up, because you're going to have people buying homes again that are actually caring about the real American Dream.""
‘Bank of Mom and Dad’ is closed
White said a recent trip to Europe reminded him of another challenge facing first-time homebuyers compared to their European counterparts. In large part, due to economic challenges, this generation’s parents don’t have the means to help their children buy their first home.
“I was over in Europe, and I got to speak to seven other countries at an international mortgage brokers federation conference, and most of the people over there still have their families able to help give them money,” White said. “We don't have that today. I'm a boomer myself. I'm not in a position, or most people, to give their kids or their grandkids the money like we used to, because we've spent our money through the crashes.”
Because the younger generations aren’t getting that help from family members, it is delaying their ability to start building generational wealth. It initiates a cycle where the process becomes increasingly delayed with each generation, resulting in effects that can persist for several generations.
“They can't afford a home, they can't save, and we have got the largest wealth inequality gap since I've been in this business in 39 years,” White said. “In the 80s, the interest rates may have been 16% but the difference was that the per capita income kept up with that inflation at that house. Today, it's not like that. Housing prices, taxes, and insurance have outpaced the average income of borrowers.”
Kristi Hardy of Atlantic Coast Mortgage says uncertainty around federal job security could cause buyers to pause, but DC’s housing shortage and resilience remain steady. Her message: stay calm, guide clients, and remind them this too shall pass.https://t.co/ZP5HnL874f
— Mortgage Professional America Magazine (@MPAMagazineUS) October 2, 2025
The inability of people to buy a home eventually becomes a belief that they will never be able to. This means there is no opportunity to create generational wealth, and it can also cause psychological damage.
“The first-time buyer who can't afford to buy a house, they don't think they'll ever buy a house,” White said. “You're not just getting away from the American Dream. You're getting away from the backbone of the American economy. A home is the biggest builder that someone can have, and it is the biggest source of self-worth. It's going to cause a crisis of lack of fulfillment, of self-worth and lack of feeling that they belong.”

By John Aguilar | jaguilar@denverpost.com | The Denver PostPUBLISHED: October 5, 2025 at 6:00 AM MDT Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...Two suburban cities south and west of Denver find themselves on distinctly different tracks in addressing a long-vexing problem — the high prices and elevated borrowing costs that box out young families and renters of all ages from buying a home.
In Lakewood, elected leaders spent the summer overhauling the city’s zoning code and land use rules. Their goal: to encourage the building of more varied housing types, and by extension greater density, in the city of 156,000, with the ultimate aim of lowering overall home prices.
In Littleton, a similar pro-density effort had sparked a furious backlash earlier this year. Now a citizen-initiated measure is bound for the Nov. 4 ballot and, if passed, it will restrict a large chunk of the city from having anything but single-family homes — a stark pivot from city leaders’ prior goal.
Each city is part of a larger density debate that has played out in communities across metro Denver and has dominated housing affordability discussions at all levels, from the Colorado statehouse to neighborhood streets.
Littleton City Councilwoman Andrea Peters, who is also a real estate agent, said the lack of “missing middle” housing in her city is having a chain-reaction effect on younger families seeking their first home as well as older people looking to downsize. That type of housing includes duplexes, triplexes and attached townhomes, which are designed to house more people per square foot but are less imposing than hulking apartment buildings or condos.
“We have an aging demographic and we don’t have a plan for younger families,” Peters said. “If we have more smaller-size options (for downsizers), that frees up that larger home for someone else.”
Mark Harris, an eight-year resident of Littleton, is part of a group dubbed Rooted in Littleton that is behind Measure 3A on this fall’s ballot. He says the goal is to stop the city from shoehorning certain housing types into neighborhoods where they don’t fit and where residents don’t want them.

“Our intent is to preserve single-family land use — that’s what we’re trying to do,” he said. “We are not anti-growth. We are not anti-affordable housing. We just don’t want duplexes, triplexes and quadplexes imposed on us.”
As high-level discussions on affordability have taken up much of the oxygen in policy debates in recent years, the issue has been tackled in the state Capitol. A collection of bills passed in 2024 and signed into law by Gov. Jared Polis was designed to increase higher-density living and bring home prices down.
Several Front Range municipalities have, in turn, sued the state, claiming its mandate to implement zoning-related changes encroached on their home rule powers to set their own land-use rules.
And at the center of it all is raw emotion.
“This place doesn’t resemble what it used to be — not at all,” said Regina Hopkins, a lifelong Lakewood resident who feels the growth in her city over the last couple decades has been out of control. “Why are local governments being forced to fix what is a state issue?”
Hopkins, 40, and others in Lakewood are exploring whether to put their own measure on the ballot to roll back what the city is expected to finalize on Oct. 13.
But for newcomer Robert Adams, Lakewood is doing the right thing. At 39, he finally got out of the rental game by purchasing a 1,200-square-foot, 1950s-era home in the city.
“After my years of renting, we bought 2½ years ago — and it’s quite a burden to afford a moderately-priced home,” he said.
While home prices have finally stagnated across metro Denver in recent months, they haven’t come down much from their record levels. The median price gain of a residential property sold in August in metro Denver was 0.3% compared to the same month a year earlier, rising to $587,000, according to a recent report from Homes.com. That was below the 2.4% annual price gain seen nationally, the site said.
In August 2021, when values were surging, metro Denver home prices rose 17.4% compared to a year earlier.
While some experts say the local housing scene has flipped to a buyer’s market, high mortgage rates are keeping things tough for those on the hunt for a listing. Adams paid $650,000 for his Lakewood house, and he carries a 6.6% interest rate on his loan.
“We can manage it, but just barely,” he said.
Need for ‘missing middle’ housing
The Lakewood City Council has already approved three rounds of updates to the city’s zoning code. Those include measures allowing diverse housing stock anywhere in the city, limiting new home sizes to 5,000 square feet, and encouraging the conversion of vacant or underused commercial buildings to housing.
Council members will cast one last vote Oct. 13 on a final zoning map. The new rules will go into effect on Jan. 1.
“Right now, Lakewood is an infill city and there’s not a lot of housing stock coming online,” Adams said. “The supply and demand effect is real. The core idea of this zoning update is that it allows more units to be built — it creates more units for people who are desperately looking for a house.”

Lakewood Mayor Wendi Strom said the overhaul had taken much of the council’s time in recent months. She remembers adjourning one council meeting just before 3 a.m. in September as its members dissected and analyzed dense zoning code documents deep into the night.
The process, she said, isn’t going to make everyone in the city happy.
“This is their home — these are the roofs over their heads,” Strom said. “And it can be concerning what’s happening on the lot next to yours.”
But the mayor has also heard impassioned pleas from young families that just can’t crack the overinflated market. Supporting the development of more housing options will help those young families as well as older residents, teachers, firefighters and first-time homebuyers, she said.
“We have seen a level of concern from young people about the changes not being made,” Strom said. “Right now, we have way more demand than supply.”
According to the Lakewood Strategic Housing Plan, released in early 2024, planners estimated that the city would need at least 5,800 new homes built over the next 10 years to satisfy anticipated demand.
At the metro level, the Denver Regional Council of Governments concluded in a September 2024 report that an area encompassing slightly beyond the Denver area would need 216,000 new housing units — whether houses or apartments or other multifamily units — by 2032.
Fifty-two thousand of them would cover the current shortage, while 164,000 of that total represent new units needed in the future, DRCOG concluded.
Houses now larger — and more expensive
Max Nardo, a housing and smart growth senior associate with the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, said the status quo simply wasn’t working. His organization has been following the Lakewood code updates closely.
“Cities in Colorado are dealing with the same housing crisis, and many are looking at the same solutions — smaller homes on smaller lots,” he said.
Lakewood’s housing assessment report concluded that nearly three-quarters of households in the city had just one or two people. It also noted that the average single-family home built since 2000 had about 2,600 square feet of space — much larger than houses built decades earlier — and sold for more than $1.1 million.
“It’s a ridiculous mismatch with what the city really needs,” Nardo said.

But Lakewood has seen at least one major institutional protest to its plans. The Green Mountain Water and Sanitation District, which serves 10,000 accounts, accounting for 48,000 residents in Lakewood, wrote a letter to the city in August. It warned that “densification” of the city’s housing stock could compromise the district’s ability to provide adequate service.
Karen Morgan, the district’s president, told The Denver Post that the district had to plan for the long term.
“We are already overcapacity with our sewer pipes,” she said. “We do not have the infrastructure to handle that density, especially since we don’t know when it’s happening.”
A potential harbinger of what could emerge in the wake of Lakewood’s update might exist in Portland, Oregon, where city leaders undertook a similar effort to encourage denser residential construction a few years ago, Nardo said.
A review of outcomes from that initiative found that between August 2021 and June 2024, the city permitted more than 1,400 accessory dwelling units — which typically include garage apartments and granny flats — and middle housing units, which the report described as duplexes to cottage clusters. The most common middle housing unit built during that period in Portland was a two-bedroom home weighing in at a cozy 900 square feet.
Most notably, according to the report, the average sale price of one of those new market-rate middle housing units in 2023 and 2024 was about $250,000 less than the price of a new single-family detached house.
Adams, the new homeowner in Lakewood, said today’s housing market is far different from what it was when many homeowners who are wary about the city’s initiative bought their properties.
“They bought in at a time when it was more affordable, and they are scared that it’s going to change overnight,” he said. “But if they look at other places that have done this, it’s a slow process.”
That gives little comfort to folks like Hopkins, 40, who took a lead in opposing the construction of a five-story apartment complex on the edge of Belmar Park in recent years. That project, she feared, would ruin the feel of a natural oasis in the middle of Lakewood. The developer overcame that fight and is now proceeding toward construction.
“One of the reasons I oppose the code changes is that a neighborhood’s character will completely change,” she said. “They’re trying to urbanize and gentrify Lakewood. They are just trying to increase density.”
‘All that does is gentrify’
In Littleton, Joe Whitney says building more units won’t necessarily translate to lower home prices. Prices are struck on more than just the availability of housing stock, he says. They also depend on construction costs and what is profitable for the builder.
He points to a recently built triplex on South Sycamore Street that offered little price relief to those looking for a home in Littleton, despite the building offering more living units than the single-family homes surrounding it. According to online records from the Arapahoe County Assessor’s Office, the three attached units were purchased for between $980,000 and $1.15 million — prices well above the metro area median.
“All that does is gentrify — it doesn’t improve affordability,” Whitney said of the new construction. “The last thing we want to see is Littleton turn into Lakewood.”
Housing economists and advocates for more density point out that there’s more complexity at play in the housing market. They argue that the building of high-end units still reduces overall pressure on rents and housing prices as residents of lower-cost homes upgrade, moving out and making those older units available.
But the gentification concern is why Rooted in Littleton chose to try and preempt the city from doing what Harris called another “sneak attack” on the city’s residents. That’s the term he uses to characterize the contretemps that occurred in January, when the council abandoned an attempt to welcome denser housing types in the city after blowback from the community.
The ballot measure, if approved by voters next month, would keep the council from bringing other types of housing to single-family neighborhoods, which Harris said cover nearly half of Littleton’s land mass.
Nothing, however, would stop homeowners from requesting permission from the city to build nonconforming structures on their lot.
“We’re not trying to tie the hands of individual property owners — we’re trying to tie the hands of a City Council that just wants density,” he said.
Mail ballots for Littleton’s election will go out beginning Friday.
Peters, the Littleton councilwoman, worries about the fiscal impact on Littleton if the measure ends up passing. The governor, in August, signed an executive order that threatened to withhold grants from cities that refuse to follow the new state housing laws.
If Littleton’s hands are tied by the restrictions laid out in the ballot measure, Peters said, “it means we’ll be out of compliance with the state and ineligible for grant money.”
Colorado Municipal League Executive Director Kevin Bommer said what’s playing out today in Littleton and Lakewood strikes on a familiar theme, “especially when the pressure to grow comes head-to-head with the desire to preserve the character of a community.”
But Bommer, a vocal opponent of state interference in municipal decisions, said “these difficult conversations are happening exactly where they are supposed to be,” at the city level.
“Local control — or local decision-making — isn’t always pretty, but it is the best way to solve local challenges and talk about the future,” he said. “This is precisely how things need to happen.”

By John Aguilar | jaguilar@denverpost.com | The Denver PostPUBLISHED: October 5, 2025 at 6:00 AM MDT Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...Two suburban cities south and west of Denver find themselves on distinctly different tracks in addressing a long-vexing problem — the high prices and elevated borrowing costs that box out young families and renters of all ages from buying a home.
In Lakewood, elected leaders spent the summer overhauling the city’s zoning code and land use rules. Their goal: to encourage the building of more varied housing types, and by extension greater density, in the city of 156,000, with the ultimate aim of lowering overall home prices.
In Littleton, a similar pro-density effort had sparked a furious backlash earlier this year. Now a citizen-initiated measure is bound for the Nov. 4 ballot and, if passed, it will restrict a large chunk of the city from having anything but single-family homes — a stark pivot from city leaders’ prior goal.
Each city is part of a larger density debate that has played out in communities across metro Denver and has dominated housing affordability discussions at all levels, from the Colorado statehouse to neighborhood streets.
Littleton City Councilwoman Andrea Peters, who is also a real estate agent, said the lack of “missing middle” housing in her city is having a chain-reaction effect on younger families seeking their first home as well as older people looking to downsize. That type of housing includes duplexes, triplexes and attached townhomes, which are designed to house more people per square foot but are less imposing than hulking apartment buildings or condos.
“We have an aging demographic and we don’t have a plan for younger families,” Peters said. “If we have more smaller-size options (for downsizers), that frees up that larger home for someone else.”
Mark Harris, an eight-year resident of Littleton, is part of a group dubbed Rooted in Littleton that is behind Measure 3A on this fall’s ballot. He says the goal is to stop the city from shoehorning certain housing types into neighborhoods where they don’t fit and where residents don’t want them.

But the gentification concern is why Rooted in Littleton chose to try and preempt the city from doing what Harris called another “sneak attack” on the city’s residents. That’s the term he uses to characterize the contretemps that occurred in January, when the council abandoned an attempt to welcome denser housing types in the city after blowback from the community.
The ballot measure, if approved by voters next month, would keep the council from bringing other types of housing to single-family neighborhoods, which Harris said cover nearly half of Littleton’s land mass.
Nothing, however, would stop homeowners from requesting permission from the city to build nonconforming structures on their lot.
“We’re not trying to tie the hands of individual property owners — we’re trying to tie the hands of a City Council that just wants density,” he said.
Mail ballots for Littleton’s election will go out beginning Friday.
Peters, the Littleton councilwoman, worries about the fiscal impact on Littleton if the measure ends up passing. The governor, in August, signed an executive order that threatened to withhold grants from cities that refuse to follow the new state housing laws.
If Littleton’s hands are tied by the restrictions laid out in the ballot measure, Peters said, “it means we’ll be out of compliance with the state and ineligible for grant money.”
Colorado Municipal League Executive Director Kevin Bommer said what’s playing out today in Littleton and Lakewood strikes on a familiar theme, “especially when the pressure to grow comes head-to-head with the desire to preserve the character of a community.”
But Bommer, a vocal opponent of state interference in municipal decisions, said “these difficult conversations are happening exactly where they are supposed to be,” at the city level.
“Local control — or local decision-making — isn’t always pretty, but it is the best way to solve local challenges and talk about the future,” he said. “This is precisely how things need to happen.”

LAS VEGAS (KSNV) — Housing in Las Vegas has become increasingly unaffordable over the past two decades, according to Prof. Nicholas Irwin, research director at the UNLV Lied Center for Real Estate. 

High Prices (KSNV)

""There was a point in time, in not the distant past, a lot of folks remember that housing was really affordable,"" Irwin said. ""Housing was affordable for everyone and that has quickly changed in just the span of 20 years."" 

How much do you need to make? (KSNV)

He noted that jobs in the area are not keeping pace with rising housing costs, making homeownership ""simply out of reach for most of the jobs in this town."" Irwin highlighted that a minimum wage worker now faces an ""impossible number of hours"" to afford a home, a situation exacerbated by pressures from West Coast housing markets. 

Where does Las Vegas stack up? (KSNV)

Despite Southern Nevada being one of the more affordable regions in the West, the influx of people from California is driving up demand without a corresponding increase in supply. 

Incomes among hospitality jobs (KSNV)

""We are not building houses at the rate we used to,"" Irwin said, citing permitting, zoning, and federal land ownership issues as contributing factors. He warned that Las Vegas is nearing the unaffordability levels seen in California, which poses a significant challenge. 

Las Vegas: In Perspective (KSNV)

For prospective homebuyers, Irwin advised, ""It is just a matter of sometimes just getting lucky. Maybe buying a slightly smaller house with a smaller payment and hoping you can upgrade in the future."" However, he acknowledged that ""getting in is the tough part"" as entry prices continue to rise while wages lag behind.

(Photo by Stephen Brashear/Getty Images for Redfin)Comment on this story10CommentShare storySharetopics: ZillowRedfinLawsuitAntitrustRental listingsCompetitionHousing crisisAttorneys generalSEATTLE, Wash. — Attorneys general in Washington and four other states filed an antitrust lawsuit Wednesday, accusing real estate giants Zillow and Redfin of illegally colluding to dominate the online rental advertising market, potentially harming renters amid a growing housing crisis.The lawsuit alleges the companies violated federal antitrust laws by striking a $100 million deal earlier this year that effectively removed Redfin as a competitor in the online listings market for multifamily rental properties.SEE ALSO | Here's how much you need to make to 'comfortably afford' a Seattle home“Amid a housing crisis in Washington, ensuring robust competition in rental advertising is vital,” Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said in a statement. “Enforcing our antitrust laws to keep the marketplace fair, protect consumers, and prevent companies from building monopolies is a priority for our office.”According to the complaint, Seattle-based Zillow paid Redfin, also headquartered in Seattle, $100 million to exit the rental listings business for properties with 25 or more units. Redfin agreed to transition clients to Zillow, incentivize its own sales staff to do the same, and display only Zillow's listings for large rental properties on its platforms.Prosecutors say this deal allowed Zillow to solidify its position as the dominant player in the multifamily rental listings market—at the expense of competition and consumer choice. Shortly after the agreement, Redfin reportedly laid off around 450 employees and shut down its rental listing operations.Attorneys general from Arizona, Connecticut, New York, and Virginia joined Washington in filing the suit. They allege the companies violated both the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Clayton Act by unlawfully eliminating competition and engaging in an anti-competitive acquisition.SEE ALSO | Amid housing affordability troubles, nearly 60% of young adults are 'rent burdened'The lawsuit seeks a court order to unwind the agreement and restore competition in the online rental marketplace.The Federal Trade Commission also filed a related complaint against Zillow and Redfin in the same court.According to the lawsuit, Zillow began building its rental listings platform in the 2010s and expanded aggressively through acquisitions of rival platforms like HotPads and Trulia. Redfin, which entered the rental listing market in 2021 by acquiring RentPath—owner of Rent.com, ApartmentGuide.com, and Rentals.com—had competed fiercely until the two companies struck the deal in early 2025.Comment with BubblesREAD THE COMMENTS (10)As of Wednesday, neither Zillow nor Redfin had issued a public response to the lawsuits.TrendingWashington state crackdown uncovers 41 unlicensed contractors in two-day operationIn a sweeping two-day enforcement operation, the Washington State Department of Labor & Industries (L&I) uncovered 41 cases of unlicensed contractors.

2025-10-02 13:45:00,"PolicyTrump’s new tariffs will slam America’s already brutal housing crisisOctober’s “kitchen cabinet” tax will affect homebuyers and renters alike.by
Rachel Cohen BoothSep 29, 2025, 4:40 PM UTCShareGiftNew homes under construction in Vacaville, California, on September 3, 2025. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesRachel Cohen Booth is a senior policy correspondent for Vox covering social policy. She focuses on housing, schools, homelessness, child care, and abortion rights, and has been reporting on these issues for more than a decade.Housing in America is about to get more expensive, thanks to new tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump that will take effect this Wednesday, October 1.The new tariffs include a 50 percent tax on imported kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, 30 percent on upholstered furniture, and 25 percent on heavy trucks used in construction. These will join existing tariffs on steel, aluminum, and lumber, which have been driving up construction costs this year. Back in April, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) estimated that tariffs were adding about $10,900 to the cost of building a typical new home — and that was before the steep August tariffs took effect. No doubt the October ones will only escalate the problem.Some companies stockpiled materials before the tariffs kicked in, creating a temporary buffer. But those inventories won’t last forever, and the building industry faces a fundamental challenge: Each additional $1,000 in home construction costs prices out more than 115,000 potential home-buying families, according to NAHB.This all comes at the worst possible time. Housing experts estimate the country needs at least 3.7 million homes to bring down costs and ease the severe housing shortage. More than 770,000 people were officially counted as homeless last year, mortgage rates hover around 6.4 percent, and nearly 75 percent of American households can’t afford a median-priced new home. The affordability crisis touches everyone — from renters competing for scarce apartments to homeowners delaying renovations to builders struggling with supply chain chaos. Now, tariffs are pouring fuel on these already raging fires.How tariffs hit buyers directlyWhen Trump slaps a 50 percent tariff on kitchen cabinets from abroad, American importers — not the foreign companies manufacturing the cabinets — pay that tax. They then pass those costs along to builders, who pass them to homebuyers. If a developer was planning to install $15,000 worth of imported cabinets in a new home, they’re now looking at an extra $7,500 in costs. Multiply that across appliances, fixtures, lumber, and steel, and the numbers add up fast.In total, about 7 percent of all goods used in new residential construction come from foreign countries, according to NAHB. That might sound small, but it represents $14 billion worth of materials in 2024 alone.The impact varies dramatically by location. A June study by the real estate firm Evernest found that tariffs could add anywhere from $26,180 to the cost of a new home in Oklahoma to over $100,000 in Hawaii. In expensive markets like California and Massachusetts, the additional costs from tariffs are estimated to exceed $60,000 per home.The Trump administration, for its part, maintains it holds no blame for whatever affordability crisis renters and homeowners might experience as a result of their trade decisions.“America’s housing affordability was dramatically worsened by Joe Biden’s open border policies that let tens of millions of illegal migrants walk into the country and overburden housing markets that were already grappling with cumbersome regulatory hurdles,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai told Vox. “The Trump administration is taking a multi-pronged approach to address housing affordability concerns: from mass deportations to deregulation to deflationary policies that are paving the way for further interest rate cuts.”Beyond sticker shock: Supply chain chaosThe tariffs aren’t just making materials more expensive — they’re making them scarcer and harder to predict. This uncertainty is in some ways more challenging for developers than the costs themselves. Developers planning projects months or years in advance suddenly confront moving targets for material prices, and this unpredictability is already showing up in construction data. Single-family housing starts fell to a near 2.5-year low in August, while permits — a leading indicator of future construction — dropped to levels not seen since April 2023.Developers have been sounding the alarm. Anthony Hrusovsky of Chicago’s Mavrek Development told the Chicago Tribune recently that tariffs “killed” negotiations with a major equity investor for a planned 25-story, 400-unit project. The tariffs introduced “a level of uncertainty around cost, which had previously been riskless in our eyes.”Gusto, a payroll services firm for small businesses, conducted an annual survey in August and September and found that 50 percent of companies thought tariffs had hurt their business this year, and 56 percent expected them to do so next year.Perhaps no material illustrates the tariff trap better than lumber. Canada supplies roughly 85 percent of all US softwood lumber imports and represents nearly a quarter of America’s total lumber supply. Last month, the Trump administration more than doubled its 14.5 percent tariff on Canadian lumber to a rate of 35 percent.The fact is that American sawmills simply don’t produce enough lumber to meet domestic demand, and it takes time to ramp up production. So homebuilders will face higher costs whether they buy Canadian lumber with tariffs or American lumber from a market with limited supply. And those costs will trickle down to everyone else.Tariffs hit renters, tooTariffs don’t just hit new construction — they’re expected to drive up renovation costs too. The levies on kitchen cabinets and on furniture mean that updating one’s home could get much more expensive. In effect, homeowners may become much less willing to invest in home improvements, potentially affecting property values and slowing the broader house renovation industry.For now, the NAHB is staying relatively quiet. In a statement released on Friday, the homebuilder trade group said they are working to get more details from the administration.For renters, the pain from the forthcoming tariffs will be more indirect but no less real. When it becomes more expensive to build apartments, developers build fewer of them. That tightens an already competitive rental market and makes things more costly for tenants. Some would-be homebuyers, priced out by higher home costs and mortgage rates, also remain in the rental market longer, further increasing demand for apartments.Then there are the ripple effects beyond construction. Tariffs can drive up prices economy-wide, keeping interest rates — and mortgage costs — elevated. Trade uncertainty has already rattled the stock market and slowed economic growth in 2025.Trump’s affordability promise meets realityThese tariff-driven cost increases are particularly maddening because they directly contradict the administration’s stated housing goals. Trump has repeatedly pledged to make housing “affordable again” and has signed executive orders directing agencies to reduce regulations that drive up housing costs.But while deregulation might save money on development costs, tariffs are adding thousands of dollars per home. Even if the administration could eliminate 25 percent of regulatory costs — an optimistic scenario — that still might not fully offset the price increases from import taxes. Earlier this month, the Budget Lab at Yale estimated that if current tariff levels remain steady, construction output could go down by 3.8 percent in the long run. And tariff levels are not remaining steady — they’re about to increase.Another irony is that Trump has publicly pressured the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, which would make mortgages cheaper, but his tariff policies make rate cuts less likely by fueling the inflation the Fed is trying to control.RelatedIf interest rates go down, do home prices go down? Not quite.All of these contradictions become even starker when combined with the administration’s immigration enforcement policies. More than one-third of construction workers are foreign-born, according to 2023 Census data, and in some states — like California and Texas — the share is much higher. The Trump administration’s immigration raids have already started to affect construction sites, and reports reveal that other foreign-born workers have stopped showing up to work out of fear. A July analysis from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute estimated that construction jobs are likely to be hardest hit from the president’s deportation agenda; the think tank estimated that the industry could shrink by over 18 percent.A 2024 study examining the Secure Communities immigration enforcement program (which was implemented between 2008 and 2013 and removed roughly 400,000 people from the US) found that the average county lost about a year’s worth of residential construction over four years following enforcement. New homes became 18 percent more expensive within three years, and overall home prices increased 10 percent.RelatedThe immigration crackdown threatening to break America’s child care systemThe paradox of Trump’s deportation pushThe researchers found that native-born workers didn’t replace deported immigrant workers — in fact, US-born construction jobs also declined. “You need the relatively lower-skilled folks to come in and frame the house before you need the relatively higher-skilled workers to come in and finish the house,” Troup Howard, the lead researcher, told Vox. “And so when you have net losses in those low-skilled occupations, it does lead to a slowdown overall.”For a country desperate to solve its housing crisis, Trump’s trade war is building a bigger problem, one tariff at a time.See More: Donald TrumpHousingPolicyPoliticsMost PopularTake a mental break with the newest Vox crosswordCities made a bet on millennials — but forgot one key thingThe Air Quality Index and how to use it, explainedTrump’s revenge campaign falls flatHow Zohran Mamdani won over Donald Trump — for nowToday, ExplainedUnderstand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

10 tons, built in seven days, and maybe a way to restore American Dream of affordable home ownership

KEY POINTS
With the median price of a single-family home at more than $422,000, relatively high 30-year fixed mortgage rates, and a nationwide shortage of housing, ownership is out of reach for many individuals and families.
Modular homebuilder Fading West, which has grown to a workforce of roughly 160 and revenue of $50 million, is planning to be part of the solution, constructing 10-ton homes in seven days or less at a factory site in Buena Vista, Colorado. 
Among its early achievements: homes shipped to Hawaii after 2023 wildfires marking the first instance of FEMA offering displaced residents the modular option rather than trailers as temporary housing.

Owning a home is one of the pillars of the American Dream. But with a nationwide housing affordability crisis headlined by a lofty median price of a single-family home at more than $422,000, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate coming down but still relatively high, and a persistent, nationwide housing shortage of nearly four million units, that dream is out of reach for many individuals and families. 

Modular homebuilder Fading West is planning to be part of the solution to this wide-ranging dilemma. Founded in 2016 in Buena Vista, Colorado, the company assembles modular homes inside a 110,000-square-foot factory. Compared to traditional on-site stick-built construction, Fading West claims its lean manufacturing principles reduce costs by up to 20% and delivers a finished house in half the time.  

""Our innovation is that we are manufacturers, not construction workers,"" said Eric Schaefer, chief business development officer at Fading West, which, besides single- and multi-family homes, also fabricates townhouses and apartment complexes. ""Modular has been around a long time,"" he said.

The industry has a history dating back a full century and has been growing again in recent years, though off a low base relative to national residential real estate statistics.

""Where we see ourselves as disruptors is our value engineering, speed, high-quality and architecturally interesting designs,"" Schaefer said. 

A case in point, if an atypical one, is Lahaina, Maui, the historic Hawaiian city that was devastated by wildfires in August 2023. Along with taking 102 lives, the conflagration destroyed nearly 2,000 homes. In coordination with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, state and local officials and New York City architecture firm DXA Studio, Fading West produced 82 brightly colored modular homes in two months, running two 12-hour shifts a day. The homes were trucked to Seattle, then shipped to Lahaina. Production took less than five months from the start of construction to completion.  

The one-, two- and three-bedroom houses, designed by DXA's Liv-Connected spinoff, ranged in cost from $165,000 to $227,000 each, according to FEMA, which paid for them. The Kilohana project — ultimately planned to comprise 167 modular units — marked the first instance of FEMA offering displaced residents modular homes instead of trailers as temporary housing, according to an agency spokeswoman.  

From disaster relief response to national affordable housing crisis

Utilizing its modular housing for disaster relief victims was a first for Fading West, too. ""We came into business with very small aspirations,"" Schaefer said. The company started out as developers, creating housing attainable for workers in the small mountain and rural towns near Buena Vista, including Colorado ski resorts such as Breckenridge, Copper Mountain and Vail, where real estate prices are as sky-high as the peaks. ""We realized that with the area's shortage of general contractors and subcontractors, building affordable new homes would be impossible,"" Schaefer said, adding that long, snowy winters were another hindrance to outdoor construction.

Initially, Fading West marketed community-themed clusters of modular houses built by other companies. But after several years, founder and CEO Charlie Chupp decided to rethink its business model in order to meet growing demands for affordable housing, not only locally but across the country. So in 2021, with funding from four private investors and state loans, it built a state-of-the-art factory.  

The size of two-and-a-half football fields, the U-shaped facility features 18 work stations, each with a different building task. The modular process begins with floors, walls and roofs, then electrical and plumbing, followed by insulation and drywall, and finally cabinets and countertops. 

""The homes are built on air casters, so they can move up a couple inches off the ground. Workers push the units from station to station every four hours,"" Schaefer said.

It typically takes about seven days to complete each 10-ton house. 

Fading West currently employs 110 non-union factory workers, making from the low to high $20s an hour, plus 50 administrative staffers and general contractors, who are on-site to set the houses on foundations and connect utilities. ""Other modular companies aren't our competition,"" Schaefer said. ""It's the traditional homebuilders. We're still a $50-million business, but in the building world that's considered a small company."" 

Only about 3%-5% of new single-family homes in Colorado are factory-built, including modular, Schaefer said. But interest in the approach is spreading, with New York State Governor Kathy Hochul announcing a plan this week that features modular homes as a key to increasing affordable housing supply statewide.

Nationally, gaining market share remains an uphill battle. Modular construction of single-family homes in a typical year makes up between 1-3% of all starts, based on last year's Census Bureau data. ""That number has been pretty constant for the past decade or so,"" said Devin Perry, assistant vice president at NAHB, who focuses on systems builders, including modular. It was as high as 7-8% in 2007-08 timeframe. The decline, ""mirrors the rest of the post-bubble housing industry,"" Perry said. ""The modular manufacturing base consolidated and shrank, so now there are fewer factories to supply modular homes.""

It's worth delineating the somewhat confusing classifications of what structures constitute off-site built housing. There are two distinct categories: manufactured and modular. Manufactured homes — AKA mobile homes or trailers — are built to a single national code, administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 

Modular homes are built to the same codes used by traditional on-site homebuilders, which include the International Building Code and state and local codes, according to Tom Hardiman, executive director of the Modular Building Institute and its sister organization, the Modular Home Builders Association. MBI represents makers of multi-family homes and commercial buildings — including hospitals, schools, office buildings and hotels — while MHBA covers those building single-family dwellings. 

Whereas modular, in all its designations, embodies a fraction of overall homebuilding in the U.S., it does address many of the nation's problems affecting housing when compared to on-site building. They're more affordable and built more quickly by skilled workers in safe, controlled, indoor environments. They reduce waste by nearly 25% and weather-related damage to materials. ""All of that leads to a more sustainable, less expensive, better-built product,"" said Jordan Rogove, partner and co-founder of DXA Studio. 

Michael Neal, a principal research associate and equity scholar at the Urban Institute who has studied the sector, agrees with this view, saying modular housing can achieve an affordable product through its production model. ""Site-built, stick-built building, particularly on the single-family side, hasn't experienced much productivity gains in the aggregate over the last few decades,"" Neal said, adding his research shows modular builders cut production time in half vs. traditional methods, which includes the often onerous permitting process. 

The approach can also solve for the lack of reliable labor that traditional homebuilders experience, with modular factories addressing that challenge by having a full-time, local, well-paid workforce that's not restricted by outdoor weather conditions. ""Maybe modular is how affordable housing is reached,"" Neal said.

Fading West ""is still kind of a startup four years into this,"" Schaefer said of its affordable-housing mission. ""Where this make sense is in the wider arena — housing for teachers, police officers, firefighters, a pretty broad range"" of aspiring homeowners, he added.

With that aim, it has launched projects in Wyoming, Utah, Montana, Texas and New Mexico. Yet Fading West is not averse to building up the income scale as well and linking that to the disaster relief mission it pioneered in Hawaii.

The company is partnering with Home/Town Developments — a group of design, building, development and real-estate leaders in Los Angeles — to provide a variety of permanent modular homes for victims of the wildfires in Pacific Palisades and Altadena, communities where the demographics vary from ultra-wealthy to middle-class. Fading West has designs for multi-million-dollar, 3,000-square-foot, five-bedroom homes, as well as more affordable 1,200-square, two-bedroom models.

The modular business model is, at its foundation, about being able to build a house to suit homeowners' desires and budgets. ""Think of these as Lego blocks,"" Schaefer said.

Housing panel seeks more local autonomy to tackle affordability in Arlington
By Scott McCaffrey
Published October 1, 2025 at 10:00AM

Arlington’s Housing Commission is seeking more local leeway in addressing affordable housing and new formulas for determining the number of affordable units in new projects.
Commission Chair Kellen MacBeth included these recommendations in a letter to the County Board following a review of policies by the Affordable Housing Ordinance working group established earlier this year. County leaders are currently developing legislative priorities for the 2026 General Assembly session.
In the letter, MacBeth said the status quo was not providing the desired results.
“Arlington County continues to fail to produce the level of affordable housing needed to meet the 2015 Affordable Housing Master Plan’s (AHMP) goals,” he wrote. “Our current supply of rental housing units affordable to residents earning up to 60% of area median income is only 12.1%, and we are not increasing supply at a rate fast enough to reach the AHMP goal of 17.7% by 2040.”
He wrote that the commission he leads has “grown frustrated” with the current requirements for developers seeking county approval for new projects.
“Today, we are collecting a lower cash contribution on a per-square-foot basis and producing fewer affordable units in exchange for allowing developers to exceed restrictions on building heights and density,” MacBeth wrote.
The working group on this topic included representatives from several county commissions, affordable-housing advocates and representatives for developers. Led by Bryan Coleman, it delivered its recommendations to the Housing Commission last month.

At the Sept. 16 Housing Commission meeting, Coleman said the experience had led participants to understand that affordable housing remains “a very nuanced issue” with potential pitfalls in making changes.
“Pulling one string out of the large ball can have effects that you don’t fully understand until it’s been played out,” he said.
As a result of the working group’s recommendations, the Housing Commission voted 8-0 asking the County Board to convene a new working group to propose options for determining how much — in either units or cash contributions — developers should be required to contribute when seeking increased density for residential and commercial projects.
Currently, developers have four options to satisfy the requirements: Including affordable units within the redeveloped property; funding units nearby; funding units elsewhere in the county; or contributing cash to the county’s Affordable Housing Investment Fund.
Currently, most developers take the cash-contribution route as the easiest and, often, most financially advantageous option.
Implementing a major change would require an update to the county’s current Affordable Housing Ordinance, which dates to 2006, as well as authorization from the General Assembly and governor. Coleman said his panel had worked closely with County Board member Maureen Coffey and State Sen. Barbara Favola to make sure the proposals were feasible.
Virginia state law limits localities’ powers to regulate affordable-housing requirements on developers. Activists have long sought more local autonomy.
“We strongly believe that the County Board, and not the General Assembly, should be the ultimate decision-makers on what those changes should be,” MacBeth wrote.
State legislators of both parties in Virginia typically have been disinclined to give localities more authority, as it dilutes their own. And any changes to the status quo might come under heavy scrutiny from developers, who wield significant power in Richmond.

2025-10-01 03:15:00,"BusinessPolicyIncreasing Housing Affordability By Cutting Crime, Indexing Cap GainsByPatrick Gleason,Contributor.Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I cover the intersection of state & federal policy and politics. Follow AuthorSep 30, 2025, 10:56pm EDTSep 30, 2025, 11:00pm EDTShareSaveEnding taxation of inflationary capital gains, reforms that strengthen property rights, and public safety measures that reduces crime, together could all help rectify the housing affordability crisis.gettyNorth Carolina lawmakers returned to Raleigh last week to pass House Bill 307, a reform package referred to by many as “Iryna’s Law” in honor of the Ukrainian refugee who was murdered on a Charlotte light rail train in August. As the Carolina Journal reported shortly after the bill received final passage on September 24, “HB 307 tightens pretrial conditions for the release of violent offenders, eliminates cashless bail, establishes a new protocol for ordering mental health evaluations in the criminal justice system, and sets a firmer timeline for appeal in death penalty cases.”“For too long, activist judges and magistrates have turned dangerous criminals loose, endangering lives and spreading chaos in our communities,” said North Carolina House Speaker Destin Hall (R) following the passage of HB 307, which Governor Josh Stein (D-N.C.) is still considering. “That ends now. Iryna Zarutska’s murder is a tragic reminder of what’s at stake. That’s why we are delivering some of the strongest tough-on-crime reforms in North Carolina history.”“The bill eliminates cashless bail for certain offenses, restricts judicial discretion in granting pretrial release, and creates a new category of ‘violent offenses’ requiring GPS monitoring, house arrest, or secured bond for those accused,” noted the Carolina Journal. “It also mandates mental health evaluations in specific cases, tightens deadlines on death penalty appeals, and adds committing a capital felony on public transportation to the list of aggravating factors that can make a defendant eligible for the death penalty. Republican leaders say the changes are designed to ensure violent and repeat offenders remain off the streets while holding magistrates more accountable for release decisions.”Reforms to reduce crime and increase public safety are a high priority for the White House and in many statehouses beyond North Carolina. While North Carolina’s HB 307 and similar proposals elsewhere aim to reduce crime, a less advertised benefit of such reforms, some influential voices are noting, is that they make affordable housing stock that was previously unsuitable for many households a viable option for families. Palmer Luckey, the tech titan who founded Oculus VR and Anduril Industries, recommended in an August 18 post on X that the “fastest way to lower average housing prices in American cities is enforcing the law/reducing criminal activity.”“Huge chunks of high-density housing are trapped in Bad Neighborhoods, no-go zones depressed well below nearby prices,” Luckey added. “Nobody with options even considers them.”Chris DeRose, an Arizona real estate developer who previously served as senior counsel to the state attorney general, says Luckey is “absolutely accurate.” “The best zoning reform couldn’t add housing nearly this fast,” he added.MORE FOR YOULeading politicians across the country, in both blue and red states, speak frequently about the historically high cost of housing and proposals that make housing more affordable, particularly for young and working class families. That talk has been accompanied by action in some states, with lawmakers in a number of red and blue states passing deregulatory reforms in recent years aimed increasing the supply of housing and reducing its cost to households. As the Pew Foundation recently highlighted, reforms that strengthen property rights and allow more housing to be built have helped alleviate rising rents and home prices in fast-growing cities like Raleigh, Austin, Nashville, and Denver. Locally-enacted reforms that strengthen property rights, as well as state preemption of local zoning restrictions that impede or block the development of new housing, are permitting the number of housing units to grow faster than would otherwise be the case in many places. Yet there are still a number of other ways in which federal, state, and local lawmakers can take action to make housing more affordable. Some housing cost mitigation proposals are less intuitive than the zoning reforms and property tax relief bills that lawmakers have pursued in recent months and years. One such proposal, which is currently being considered by the White House and congressional leaders for inclusion in the next reconciliation package, is the indexation of capital gains for inflation.Setting aside that fact that nobody is in a place to determine how big or small of a house another person or family needs, many baby boomers continue to reside in houses whose size exceeds their perceived needs for a host of reasons. Michael Batnick and Ben Carlson, professional wealth managers who cohost the podcast Animal Spirits, recently discussed the backlash and anti-baby boomer sentiment generated online in response to a recent survey finding that “61% of boomers never plan to sell their homes.”“Why would they?,” Batnik asked rhetorically, pointing out that there is no logical reason that freeing up housing stock for younger buyers should be a motivating factor for older homeowners to put their house on the market. “What are they supposed to do?,” Carlson added, “where are they supposed to go?”Batnik and Carlson are correct that it’s irrational for lawmakers or anyone to expect baby boomers, or home owners of any age, to sell a house that they still like living in, and in many cases own outright, just so strangers can have a chance to live there. Indexing capital gains for inflation, however, creates a significant financial incentive for older homeowners who might not otherwise consider downsizing or capitalizing on a long held asset that has appreciated greatly over two or three decades.Since inflation accounts for a considerable share, in some cases most of the gain in the value of homes that many baby boomers have been in for decades, indexing capital gains for inflation would significantly reduce the tax owed when baby boomers go to sell their house. Creating such a strong incentive for empty-nesters to downsize would help free up housing stock that is well suited for younger and larger families‘Inflation Tax’ On Homes Contributes To The U.S. Housing Affordability Crisis“The fact is, Boomers with smart financial advisors won’t sell their empty nester family homes due to the taxes they would pay—much of it on merely inflationary gains,” says Ryan Ellis, an IRS-enrolled agent who runs a tax preparation firm. “They’re being advised to die still owning the homes, so that their kids can inherit them tax free and with stepped up basis. Meanwhile, Millenial and Gen Z families looking for their ‘forever homes’ have fewer options to buy. The tax code’s ‘inflation tax’ on homes is a contributor to America’s housing inventory crisis.”Indexation of capital gains for inflation would be a boon to homeowners as well as those invested in the stock market, which includes the majority of American households. Inflation accounts for a notable portion of most capital gains. In some cases, the entire gain is attributable to inflation. The lack of inflation indexing for capital gains forces many Americans to pay taxes on inflationary stock gains and even when there has been no real gain at all. In making the case for capital gains to be indexed for inflation, Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) offers the following example:“A taxpayer that purchases one share of Coca-Cola stock in 1998 would have paid $32.38 per share. Today, that share would be worth $48.13 with a gain of $15.76 and a tax liability of $3.75. However, because of inflation, the value of a dollar in 1998 is worth $1.56. The inflation adjusted value of the stock is therefore $50.50 and the taxpayer has an inflation adjusted loss of $2.38.”Some leading Democrats used to be in favor of indexing capital gains for inflation. “If we really want to increase growth, there are proposals that we can do,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), then a congressman, said in a 1992 House floor speech, adding that he “would be for indexing all capital gains and savings and borrowing.”There is contextual basis for indexing of capital gains for inflation and legal precedent indicates that such a change can be made by executive action. ATR notes that “the IRS already makes inflation adjustments for over 60 tax provisions every year including adjusting individual income tax brackets, the standard deduction, and the Earned Income Tax Credit.”“In addition, the authority to index capital gains taxes is based on existing legal precedent as outlined in legal memos (see here and here),” ATR adds. “According to these studies the cost basis of an asset when calculating the capital gains tax does not necessarily mean historical cost.”Though there is a strong case that the Trump administration can unilaterally index capital gains for inflation by administrative action, many would like to see Congress codify that change. Doing so would ensure that indexation of capital gains for inflation could not be easily undone by a future administration, providing the certainty needed for this change realize its economic growth-boosting potential.The need to rectify the housing affordability crisis remains a high priority across the U.S., particularly in the nation’s fastest growing locales. Fortunately for lawmakers seeking to address the matter, there are a broad array of reforms in the prospective policy toolkit from which to choose, many of which are complementary reforms primarily aimed at other laudable goals, such as crime reduction and tax relief.

The cost of owning a home in the US has surged since the Covid-19 pandemic. The median home price in August was $413,000, up from $321,000 during the same month in 2020 ‚Äî a 28% increase, according to federal data.
To better understand this strain on some families, CNN turned to a home ownership affordability index published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. It measures the affordability for median-income households across the US who are hoping to buy a median-priced home in a given area.
The index compares the actual median household income to the ‚Äúqualified‚Äù income needed to keep annual housing costs at or below 30%.
An index score of 100 or higher indicates the median household income is enough to afford the median-priced home based at that threshold. A score less than 100 means the median income is not enough for a median-priced home.
CNN is tracking this index as it‚Äôs periodically updated by the Atlanta Fed. Look up your area to see the trends over time ‚Äî‚ÄØand how they compare with the national average.
The Atlanta Fed‚Äôs housing data is available at both the national level and for individual core-based statistical areas, or CBSAs. It‚Äôs updated monthly, though there‚Äôs typically a two-month lag ‚Äî mainly because of the time it takes to record and collect home sales deeds. In some regions, the data can show noticeable fluctuations due to seasonal changes in median home prices or shifts in the volume of sales used to calculate those medians.
The Atlanta Fed‚Äôs data comes from its Home Ownership Affordability Monitor, or HOAM. It factors in the monthly principal and interest cost, given the current mortgage interest rates, as well as taxes, property insurance and private mortgage insurance in the total cost of home ownership.
‚ÄúThe HOAM index is designed to easily track affordability over time in the United States across geographies,‚Äù said Domonic Purviance, a real estate expert with the Atlanta Fed who helped develop the tool.
The center of gravity on affordability has shifted dramatically across the country during the last five years, according to a CNN analysis of the data.
Most metropolitan areas are now on the more expensive side of the threshold.
This nationwide shift varies by region.
Today, most metropolitan areas in the West, for example, are too expensive for the median household under the income threshold. The Midwest has gotten dramatically more expensive, too.

NPR's series Cost of Living: The Price We Pay is examining what's driving price increases and how people are coping after years of stubborn inflation. How are higher prices changing the way you live? Fill out this form to share your story with NPR.
What's the issue? Home prices How have housing prices changed since before the pandemic? They're up 56% since February 2020, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. Why has the price gone up? There are too many buyers for too few homes. Several reasons explain the supply shortage, including a lag in home building, rising construction costs and high mortgage rates that discourage current homeowners from moving and giving up their lower rate.

After Hayley Currier and  Tammy Kremer put in an offer on a house, they paced around the backyard of the apartment they shared, nerves jangling. ""We've done everything we can,"" Kremer said. ""And all we can do is be anxious at each other,"" Currier added, before laughing. Currier and Kremer, both in their late 30s, are longtime friends who bonded over their mutual passions for open-water swimming, Jewish rituals and political organizing. They've lived together for the last nine months in a rental in Berkeley, Calif., along with one other roommate.

This shared home has given Currier what she calls ""such a beautiful community and feeling of connection and home."" It has also confirmed for her that she and Kremer would live well together for the long term.

The ideal arrangement, she says, is that ""Tammy and I still have intertwined lives and lives that we get to build together, but just a little bit of private space also."" Perhaps a duplex, the two of them thought, or two units on the same plot of land. So in March, they started searching for a place to buy together. The draws of co-buying  A significant number of Americans have done what Currier and Kremer are doing. Several housing industry reports from 2024 found that about 15% of homebuyers bought their home with a friend or relative.

Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at the real estate company Redfin, got wind of the growing interest in co-buying through stories from the company's agents. "" We've heard of more buyers having to team up to be able to afford a home,"" she says. "" This is a story that we've been hearing really for a long time because affordability just keeps getting worse and worse."" Part of the allure of co-buying is that, in an era of rising prices, two wallets are better than one. Home prices have risen more than 50% since 2020.

""Five years ago, the median household would be able to buy a typical home with room to spare,"" says Kara Ng, a senior economist at the real estate marketplace company Zillow. ""Now the median owner would need a $17,000 raise in order to afford a typical home,  and that's assuming they already saved 20% down."" In some parts of the U.S., homeownership is even further out of reach. Ng says that in California, the median earner would need a six-figure raise. California happens to be where Currier and Kremer were looking for a home. Like other co-buyers who spoke to NPR, Kremer couldn't afford to buy alone, at least not where she wants to live.

Housing prices are causing some people to have smaller families than planned

Home sales are ticking up — and more are coming to market
Though housing prices are steep for everyone, Kremer and Currier have an additional economic factor working against them: They're single. ""There is a couple's advantage where if you're one person shopping for a home, the amount of listings you can afford is relatively small,"" says Ng. ""But the moment you partner with another person, it unlocks a whole lot of listings for you."" According to an analysis from Zillow, a couple in the U.S. earning the median income can afford nearly quadruple the number of listings as an individual buyer can. As Americans increasingly delay or forgo marriage, more and more prospective buyers are on the losing end of the couple's advantage.

Co-buying with a friend or relative is a work-around, allowing people to combine income and assets, especially in areas where the housing stock is mostly single-family homes. ""If there were more duplexes or triplexes available, then people would have an easier entry point to be able to afford a home alone,"" Fairweather says. ""But since single-family homes are often the only homes available and they tend to be maybe larger than what an individual might need, it makes more sense to team up with somebody."" Obstacles to co-buying When Currier's mother, Sari Currier, first heard about her daughter's plan, she thought, ""Oh, this sounds so bad."" ""It's not something my generation did. You didn't buy property with someone else,"" she says.
It's Been a Minute
Welcome to midlife, millennials. Are you in crisis?
Economy
Could a 'silver tsunami' of aging Americans fix the housing crisis?
Research backs her up. Surveys show that younger people are more likely to co-buy. Millennial homeowners were more likely to have purchased a home with one or more friends (14%) than Gen X homeowners (4%) or baby boomer homeowners (1%), according to a 2024 survey from the consumer finance company Bankrate. And a 2024 report from the insurance agency JW Surety Bonds found that 70% of Generation Z is willing to co-buy with a friend, the highest of any generation it surveyed. Sari Currier understands that homeownership has become less far affordable for younger people. But she still had concerns about her daughter co-buying with a friend. Unlike married couples, friends don't have built-in legal protections for splitting property if they want to part ways. So she wrote up a list of questions for her daughter and Kremer to discuss — more than two dozen. They include: If one person can't afford the property tax, is the other liable for the whole amount? If a problem inside one unit affects the other, who pays? What happens when one wants to sell the property? Housing experts advise people who co-buy to put an agreement in writing, as Currier and Kremer have done. ""Whether you're romantically involved or not romantically involved, you need to plan for those worst-case scenarios,"" Fairweather says. "" You never know what's going to happen if one of you loses your job or one of you needs to move or you decide to break up.""

Co-buying isn't all about money Some people don't co-buy solely for financial reasons. They do it for companionship. A 2024 Zillow report found that many buyers chose this route because they didn't want to live alone. That's also true for Kremer. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she'd lived on her own in a studio apartment. ""There was something about having my own space that felt like this notion of adulthood, of having made it,"" she recalls. But she was lonely: "" I missed the feeling of coming home to people, and I missed the feeling of sharing food and being in community."" That won't be a problem for her anymore. Though Currier and Kremer didn't get the house they bid on this summer, by September they had cause to celebrate. Their offer on another property — two units on one lot, with a shared yard — was accepted. Now, it's possible for them to turn a design idea they'd dreamed up into a reality: stringing tin cans between their units to talk to each other.

 Room for Rent: Could co-living help solve an affordability crisis in Spokane?

Brandon Whitmarsh presentation to Spokane Plan Commission (public record) 
Photos from the early 1900s show how prevalent single occupant units, otherwise known as rooms for rent, used to be.    

As Washington tries to create more housing for the future, it’s finding inspiration from the past.
It’s going to get easier to build boarding house-style buildings in Spokane.
That type of housing is now called co-living, and it’s what Washington state is requiring all its cities to allow more of.
“Co-living is a kind of residential development where you have the individual sleeping units which are rentable as individual units, but they do share the cooking facilities,"" said Spokane city planner Brandon Whitmarsh.
Whitmarsh told the plan commission last week that this isn’t a new idea.
“This is a housing type that was historically very common, similar to middle housing in the late 1800s, early 1900s as the city was experiencing a significant population boom,"" he said.
This kind of housing fell out of vogue after World War II.
Now the state is looking to bring co-living back.
Olympia says every city must allow co-living anywhere it allows housing with six units or more.
In Spokane, that’s almost everywhere within city limits. That could mean more housing options for people who make below the area median income, or AMI.
“This is the type of housing that throughout the state, the Department of Commerce is saying is seen at the market rate level to be affordable to households as low as 50% AMI,"" Whitmarsh said. ""So, just recognizing that this has the potential to aid in filling that need without having [subsidies] like those 1590 funds or some other form of subsidized housing.”
1590 funds are local sales tax revenues that are used to subsidize housing.
The city will update its code to be in line with state law by the end of the year.

The City of Reno has launched a new interactive housing dashboard aimed at providing residents and decision-makers with up-to-date information on housing needs, affordability, and trends.Unveiled during Housing America Month, the tool is part of the Reno City Council’s broader effort to address the region’s ongoing housing challenges.“I hear from residents every day about how challenging the housing market has become, and that’s why this dashboard is such an important tool,” said Reno Mayor Hillary Schieve. “Our Council is looking forward to using these new insights to make meaningful decisions to help address our community’s housing needs.”The dashboard reflects data from the recently completed 2025 Housing Needs Assessment and will be updated regularly. It highlights how many homes are needed, what types of housing are being built, and includes benchmarks for both renters and homeowners.It also features demographic insights, including household income, household size, and preferences for housing types like apartments, condos, townhomes, or single-family homes.Reno City Manager Jackie Bryant and Housing Manager Elaine Wiseman explain the tool’s features in a new informational video available on the City’s website and social media pages.“We’re excited to launch this new housing dashboard, which gives our team a clearer, more accurate picture of Reno’s housing market across all income levels and the gaps that exist,” said Bryant. “This dashboard represents a significant step forward in the City’s ongoing commitment to working with our partners to expand housing opportunities for the Biggest Little City.”Since 2016, home prices in Reno have increased by 93 percent. According to the dashboard, at least 15,000 new homes are needed over the next 10 years, including 9,000 units considered affordable for households earning below 80 percent of the area median income.Currently, a household earning $50,000 annually can afford a monthly rent of around $1,250. The dashboard also shows a growing need for home ownership opportunities with monthly mortgages ranging from $2,500 to $3,750.The City encourages residents, housing partners, and stakeholders to explore the dashboard, which is available on the Housing and Neighborhood Development section of the City of Reno’s website.

 Key takeaways 
 
Gov. Wes Moore signed Housing Starts Here executive order. 
Maryland faces a 96,000-unit housing deficit statewide. 
Initiative targets faster housing permits and state land use. 
Plan promotes transit-oriented development to cut costs.  
  
Gov. Wes Moore signed an executive order on Sept. 3 aimed at tackling Maryland’s escalating housing affordability crisis. The Housing Starts Here initiative seeks to expedite housing development, reduce production delays and make home ownership more accessible across the state. 
According to the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), the state faces a deficit of around 96,000 housing units – a gap that has been widening over recent years.

The 2025 Maryland Housing Needs Assessment, an analysis of Maryland’s housing gap conducted by DHCD and The National Center for Smart Growth, reveals significant disparities in housing availability across the state. Counties like Montgomery and Howard have median home prices exceeding $600,000, making homeownership unattainable for low and middle income residents. 
Conversely, areas such as Allegany and Wicomico counties report median home prices below $200,000, which indicates regional inconsistencies in the Maryland housing market. 
The executive order will broadly target each county in Maryland in order to create more housing development throughout the state.

“[The executive order] says that everybody has a piece of the housing crisis, and everybody deserves for their local and state governments to be working in concert to solve that crisis,” DHCD Secretary Jake Day said. 
In more than half of Maryland counties, renters are spending more than one-third of their annual income on housing costs, which is considered unaffordable by federal standards. 
While Maryland’s median income is 28% higher than the national median, the state’s median home price is 35% higher, highlighting the disproportionate cost of housing. 
“How we got here is really the post-2008 financial crisis. It was real-estate driven… that had to do with risks that the financial industry took at the time,” Secretary Day said. “It led to a collapse in the economy, in residential home values and more. The over-correction of the market meant we stopped building houses at a pace that matched population growth.” 
The Housing Starts Here Executive Order directs state agencies to identify underutilized state-owned properties suitable for transit-oriented development, aiming to increase housing density in areas with existing infrastructure. 
Transit-oriented development is a strategy that promotes dense, mixed-use communities around transit to help increase ridership and the use of public transportation. 
“There are a lot of benefits to it… we want to develop state-owned land for transit-oriented development, since state-owned land is not currently taxable. There’s no revenue generation for the states or local jurisdictions. It also provides an opportunity for Marylanders to live closer to transit and use it more,” Maryland Department of Transportation’s Chief of Real Estate and Transit-Oriented Development, David Zaidain, said. 
According to Zaidain, transportation is the second biggest household budget item behind housing. It costs roughly $600 a month for Marylanders to own a car, which is pushing the state towards more transit usage. 
Zaidain also noted the climate change benefits that come with transit-oriented development. 
The executive order directs the state to speed up timelines for housing permits and establish a state housing ombudsman, or overseer, to help projects move forward. 
The legislation comes on the heels of a 2024 legislative package that made housing more affordable and accessible for Marylanders struggling with construction barriers, along with creating the Office of Tenant and Landlord Affairs. 
The Housing Starts Here order also directs agencies to track housing production progress annually, coordinate with local governments to address regional shortages and ensure accountability across jurisdictions. 
By centralizing oversight and removing barriers, the administration aims to close the housing deficit and expand affordable options for Marylanders in the years ahead. 
“When regulatory processes add cost, that cost has to be recouped – either with higher rents or a higher sales price. So, the more regulatory burden we place, the more likely it is that we’re just producing expensive [places] for people to live,” Secretary Day said. “By cutting time and money out of the process, by streamlining it, we can make it easier to get to the finish line.”

2025-09-27 04:15:00,"PolicyTrump’s new tariffs will slam America’s already brutal housing crisisOctober’s “kitchen cabinet” tax will affect homebuyers and renters alike.by
Rachel Cohen BoothSep 29, 2025, 4:40 PM UTCShareGiftNew homes under construction in Vacaville, California, on September 3, 2025. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesRachel Cohen Booth is a senior policy correspondent for Vox covering social policy. She focuses on housing, schools, homelessness, child care, and abortion rights, and has been reporting on these issues for more than a decade.Housing in America is about to get more expensive, thanks to new tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump that will take effect this Wednesday, October 1.The new tariffs include a 50 percent tax on imported kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, 30 percent on upholstered furniture, and 25 percent on heavy trucks used in construction. These will join existing tariffs on steel, aluminum, and lumber, which have been driving up construction costs this year. Back in April, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) estimated that tariffs were adding about $10,900 to the cost of building a typical new home — and that was before the steep August tariffs took effect. No doubt the October ones will only escalate the problem.Some companies stockpiled materials before the tariffs kicked in, creating a temporary buffer. But those inventories won’t last forever, and the building industry faces a fundamental challenge: Each additional $1,000 in home construction costs prices out more than 115,000 potential home-buying families, according to NAHB.This all comes at the worst possible time. Housing experts estimate the country needs at least 3.7 million homes to bring down costs and ease the severe housing shortage. More than 770,000 people were officially counted as homeless last year, mortgage rates hover around 6.4 percent, and nearly 75 percent of American households can’t afford a median-priced new home. The affordability crisis touches everyone — from renters competing for scarce apartments to homeowners delaying renovations to builders struggling with supply chain chaos. Now, tariffs are pouring fuel on these already raging fires.How tariffs hit buyers directlyWhen Trump slaps a 50 percent tariff on kitchen cabinets from abroad, American importers — not the foreign companies manufacturing the cabinets — pay that tax. They then pass those costs along to builders, who pass them to homebuyers. If a developer was planning to install $15,000 worth of imported cabinets in a new home, they’re now looking at an extra $7,500 in costs. Multiply that across appliances, fixtures, lumber, and steel, and the numbers add up fast.In total, about 7 percent of all goods used in new residential construction come from foreign countries, according to NAHB. That might sound small, but it represents $14 billion worth of materials in 2024 alone.The impact varies dramatically by location. A June study by the real estate firm Evernest found that tariffs could add anywhere from $26,180 to the cost of a new home in Oklahoma to over $100,000 in Hawaii. In expensive markets like California and Massachusetts, the additional costs from tariffs are estimated to exceed $60,000 per home.The Trump administration, for its part, maintains it holds no blame for whatever affordability crisis renters and homeowners might experience as a result of their trade decisions.“America’s housing affordability was dramatically worsened by Joe Biden’s open border policies that let tens of millions of illegal migrants walk into the country and overburden housing markets that were already grappling with cumbersome regulatory hurdles,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai told Vox. “The Trump administration is taking a multi-pronged approach to address housing affordability concerns: from mass deportations to deregulation to deflationary policies that are paving the way for further interest rate cuts.”Beyond sticker shock: Supply chain chaosThe tariffs aren’t just making materials more expensive — they’re making them scarcer and harder to predict. This uncertainty is in some ways more challenging for developers than the costs themselves. Developers planning projects months or years in advance suddenly confront moving targets for material prices, and this unpredictability is already showing up in construction data. Single-family housing starts fell to a near 2.5-year low in August, while permits — a leading indicator of future construction — dropped to levels not seen since April 2023.Developers have been sounding the alarm. Anthony Hrusovsky of Chicago’s Mavrek Development told the Chicago Tribune recently that tariffs “killed” negotiations with a major equity investor for a planned 25-story, 400-unit project. The tariffs introduced “a level of uncertainty around cost, which had previously been riskless in our eyes.”Gusto, a payroll services firm for small businesses, conducted an annual survey in August and September and found that 50 percent of companies thought tariffs had hurt their business this year, and 56 percent expected them to do so next year.Perhaps no material illustrates the tariff trap better than lumber. Canada supplies roughly 85 percent of all US softwood lumber imports and represents nearly a quarter of America’s total lumber supply. Last month, the Trump administration more than doubled its 14.5 percent tariff on Canadian lumber to a rate of 35 percent.The fact is that American sawmills simply don’t produce enough lumber to meet domestic demand, and it takes time to ramp up production. So homebuilders will face higher costs whether they buy Canadian lumber with tariffs or American lumber from a market with limited supply. And those costs will trickle down to everyone else.Tariffs hit renters, tooTariffs don’t just hit new construction — they’re expected to drive up renovation costs too. The levies on kitchen cabinets and on furniture mean that updating one’s home could get much more expensive. In effect, homeowners may become much less willing to invest in home improvements, potentially affecting property values and slowing the broader house renovation industry.For now, the NAHB is staying relatively quiet. In a statement released on Friday, the homebuilder trade group said they are working to get more details from the administration.For renters, the pain from the forthcoming tariffs will be more indirect but no less real. When it becomes more expensive to build apartments, developers build fewer of them. That tightens an already competitive rental market and makes things more costly for tenants. Some would-be homebuyers, priced out by higher home costs and mortgage rates, also remain in the rental market longer, further increasing demand for apartments.Then there are the ripple effects beyond construction. Tariffs can drive up prices economy-wide, keeping interest rates — and mortgage costs — elevated. Trade uncertainty has already rattled the stock market and slowed economic growth in 2025.Trump’s affordability promise meets realityThese tariff-driven cost increases are particularly maddening because they directly contradict the administration’s stated housing goals. Trump has repeatedly pledged to make housing “affordable again” and has signed executive orders directing agencies to reduce regulations that drive up housing costs.But while deregulation might save money on development costs, tariffs are adding thousands of dollars per home. Even if the administration could eliminate 25 percent of regulatory costs — an optimistic scenario — that still might not fully offset the price increases from import taxes. Earlier this month, the Budget Lab at Yale estimated that if current tariff levels remain steady, construction output could go down by 3.8 percent in the long run. And tariff levels are not remaining steady — they’re about to increase.Another irony is that Trump has publicly pressured the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, which would make mortgages cheaper, but his tariff policies make rate cuts less likely by fueling the inflation the Fed is trying to control.RelatedIf interest rates go down, do home prices go down? Not quite.All of these contradictions become even starker when combined with the administration’s immigration enforcement policies. More than one-third of construction workers are foreign-born, according to 2023 Census data, and in some states — like California and Texas — the share is much higher. The Trump administration’s immigration raids have already started to affect construction sites, and reports reveal that other foreign-born workers have stopped showing up to work out of fear. A July analysis from the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute estimated that construction jobs are likely to be hardest hit from the president’s deportation agenda; the think tank estimated that the industry could shrink by over 18 percent.A 2024 study examining the Secure Communities immigration enforcement program (which was implemented between 2008 and 2013 and removed roughly 400,000 people from the US) found that the average county lost about a year’s worth of residential construction over four years following enforcement. New homes became 18 percent more expensive within three years, and overall home prices increased 10 percent.RelatedThe immigration crackdown threatening to break America’s child care systemThe paradox of Trump’s deportation pushThe researchers found that native-born workers didn’t replace deported immigrant workers — in fact, US-born construction jobs also declined. “You need the relatively lower-skilled folks to come in and frame the house before you need the relatively higher-skilled workers to come in and finish the house,” Troup Howard, the lead researcher, told Vox. “And so when you have net losses in those low-skilled occupations, it does lead to a slowdown overall.”For a country desperate to solve its housing crisis, Trump’s trade war is building a bigger problem, one tariff at a time.See More: Donald TrumpHousingPolicyPoliticsMost PopularTake a mental break with the newest Vox crosswordCities made a bet on millennials — but forgot one key thingThe Air Quality Index and how to use it, explainedTrump’s revenge campaign falls flatHow Zohran Mamdani won over Donald Trump — for nowToday, ExplainedUnderstand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.Email (required)Sign UpBy submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice.

The cost of owning a home in the US has surged since the Covid-19 pandemic. The median home price in August was $413,000, up from $321,000 during the same month in 2020 ‚Äî a 28% increase, according to federal data.
To better understand this strain on some families, CNN turned to a home ownership affordability index published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. It measures the affordability for median-income households across the US who are hoping to buy a median-priced home in a given area.
The index compares the actual median household income to the ‚Äúqualified‚Äù income needed to keep annual housing costs at or below 30%.
An index score of 100 or higher indicates the median household income is enough to afford the median-priced home based at that threshold. A score less than 100 means the median income is not enough for a median-priced home.
CNN is tracking this index as it‚Äôs periodically updated by the Atlanta Fed. Look up your area to see the trends over time ‚Äî‚ÄØand how they compare with the national average.
The Atlanta Fed‚Äôs housing data is available at both the national level and for individual core-based statistical areas, or CBSAs. It‚Äôs updated monthly, though there‚Äôs typically a two-month lag ‚Äî mainly because of the time it takes to record and collect home sales deeds. In some regions, the data can show noticeable fluctuations due to seasonal changes in median home prices or shifts in the volume of sales used to calculate those medians.
The Atlanta Fed‚Äôs data comes from its Home Ownership Affordability Monitor, or HOAM. It factors in the monthly principal and interest cost, given the current mortgage interest rates, as well as taxes, property insurance and private mortgage insurance in the total cost of home ownership.
‚ÄúThe HOAM index is designed to easily track affordability over time in the United States across geographies,‚Äù said Domonic Purviance, a real estate expert with the Atlanta Fed who helped develop the tool.
The center of gravity on affordability has shifted dramatically across the country during the last five years, according to a CNN analysis of the data.
Most metropolitan areas are now on the more expensive side of the threshold.
This nationwide shift varies by region.
Today, most metropolitan areas in the West, for example, are too expensive for the median household under the income threshold. The Midwest has gotten dramatically more expensive, too.
