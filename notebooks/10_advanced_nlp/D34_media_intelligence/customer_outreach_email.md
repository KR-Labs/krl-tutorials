# Customer Discovery Outreach Email

## Email Template (Short Version - Recommended)

**Subject**: Quick feedback on policy media analysis tool

Hi [Name],

I'm building a media intelligence tool for policy analysts and would love **15 minutes** of your time to get feedback on a prototype.

**Specific question:** Does automated identification of regional narrative patterns help with your work, or is this solving a problem you don't have?

No sales pitch—just trying to understand if this is useful before building more features.

Would you be open to a quick call next week?

Best,
Brandon

**P.S.** Here's what it does: Analyzes 1,000+ news articles to automatically identify how media coverage differs across geographic regions (e.g., "Texas coverage is 18% more negative on housing policy than California"). Wondering if policy analysts would find this valuable.

## Email Template (Slightly Longer - If You Have Warm Connection)

**Subject**: 15 min feedback request: regional media analysis for policy work

Hi [Name],

Hope you're doing well! Quick request:

I've built a prototype tool that analyzes regional patterns in policy media coverage. It processes 1,000+ news articles and automatically identifies:
- Which regions frame issues differently
- Geographic clusters of similar narratives
- Regional sentiment compared to national baseline

**Example output**: "Housing affordability coverage in Texas is 18% more negative than the national average, concentrated in Austin and Dallas metro areas."

**My question for you:** Would something like this be useful in your work? Or am I solving a problem that doesn't exist?

I'd love **15 minutes** on a call to show you a demo and get your honest feedback. No sales pitch—genuinely trying to validate whether this is worth building out.

Available next week? Let me know a couple times that work.

Thanks!
Brandon

**P.S.** This uses GDELT's database (758M+ news signals, 80%+ geolocated) + spatial-semantic clustering to find regional patterns automatically. Happy to share technical details if you're interested.

## Follow-Up Email (If No Response After 3 Days)

**Subject**: Re: Quick feedback on policy media analysis tool

Hi [Name],

Following up on my email from [day]—totally understand if you're swamped!

Would still love 15 minutes of your time to get feedback on a media analysis prototype. Specifically wondering if automated regional narrative detection is useful for policy work, or if I'm building something nobody needs.

Any chance you're free next week for a quick call?

Thanks,
Brandon

## Calendar Invite Template (After They Say Yes)

**Subject**: 15 min call: Media analysis tool feedback

**Description**:
Thanks for taking the time to chat!

**Agenda** (15 minutes total):
- Your current workflow (5 min): How do you monitor media coverage today?
- Quick demo (5 min): I'll show you the prototype
- Feedback (5 min): Is this useful? What would make it worth paying for?

**What I'm showing:**
A tool that analyzes 1,000+ news articles to identify regional narrative patterns in policy coverage. Automatically detects how coverage differs by geography.

**No sales pitch**—genuinely trying to validate if this solves a real problem before investing more time.

Looking forward to it!
Brandon

## Discovery Call Script

### Opening (2 min)
"Thanks for making time! Just to set expectations: this is purely feedback—no sales pitch. I'm trying to figure out if this tool solves a real problem before I invest more time building it."

"Can I start by asking: how do you currently monitor media coverage for your policy work?"

### Listen & Probe (5 min)
- **Current tools**: What do you use? (Meltwater, Google Alerts, manual?)
- **Pain points**: What's most frustrating about your current approach?
- **Gaps**: What questions can't you answer easily?
- **Time**: How much time per week do you spend on this?

### Demo (5 min)
"Let me show you what I've built..."

[Share screen, run notebook]

**Key things to highlight:**
1. Regional clustering map (visual)
2. Comparative sentiment ("Texas 18% more negative")
3. Automated narrative detection

"This runs on GDELT—758 million news signals, updated every 15 minutes."

### Feedback (3 min)
- "What's most interesting here?"
- "What's missing or wrong?"
- "If this solved [pain point they mentioned], what would it be worth?"
- "Would you do a 3-month pilot at $10K?"

### Close
"This is super helpful. Can I follow up if I make changes based on your feedback?"

"Also—do you know anyone else who might find this useful?"

## Success Criteria

**After 15 calls, you want:**

✅ **3+ people say**: "I would seriously consider a $10K pilot"
→ Build MVP, pursue as business

⚠️ **1-2 people say**: "Interesting but not worth $10K"
→ Adjust pricing/positioning, do 5 more calls

❌ **0 people say**: "This solves a real problem"
→ Excellent portfolio piece, move to next idea

---

## Common Objections & Responses

**"We already use Meltwater/Brandwatch"**
→ "Totally. What I'm curious about: do those show you *regional* patterns? Like, can you see that Texas frames housing policy differently than California?"

**"This seems expensive for what it is"**
→ "Fair! What price point would make sense for a 3-month pilot? And what would it need to do to be worth that?"

**"We don't have budget for this"**
→ "Got it. Hypothetically, if you did have budget, would this solve a problem you actually have?"

**"I'd need to see it work on our specific topics"**
→ "Perfect—I can run it on whatever topic you want. What's a current policy issue you're monitoring?"

**"This is cool but we're not the buyer"**
→ "Helpful to know! Who would be? And can you intro me?"

Ask more than you talk. Listen for pain points. Be brutally honest with yourself about what you hear.
