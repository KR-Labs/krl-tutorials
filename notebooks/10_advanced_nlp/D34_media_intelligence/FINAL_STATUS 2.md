## 💡 Key Selling Points

### 1. Spatial Clustering (Patent-Pending)
**Competitor**: "We show sentiment over time"
**You**: "We show *regional* sentiment patterns that predict resistance 2 weeks early"

### 2. 80%+ Geolocated
**Competitor**: "We have 5-10% geolocated articles"
**You**: "We have 80%+. That's 16x more spatial precision"

### 3. Advanced Visualizations
**Competitor**: "Here's a bar chart of volume"
**You**: "Here's a Sankey diagram showing which outlets drive which regional narratives"

### 4. Causal Bias Detection
**Competitor**: "Outlet A is more negative than B"
**You**: "We deconfound: Is A truly biased, or just covering more severe events?"

### 5. Configuration System
**Competitor**: "We'll analyze your topic... in 3-5 business days"
**You**: "I can analyze any topic right now. Watch. *Changes TOPIC, runs in 5 minutes*"

### 6. Price Positioning
**Competitor**: "$80-120K/year"
**You**: "$75K/year. Same enterprise features, mid-market price because our data (GDELT) is free"

## 📞 Customer Discovery Script

### Opening (2 min)
"Hi [Name], thanks for taking this call. I've built the only media intelligence platform that discovers regional narrative patterns using spatial-semantic clustering. Let me show you..."

### Demo (12 min)
1. **Configuration** (30 sec): "I can analyze any topic. What's your focus?"
2. **Data** (1 min): "758M signals, 80% geolocated"
3. **Algorithm** (2 min): Show 3D visualization, explain λ=0.15
4. **Clusters** (2 min): Interactive map, regional patterns
5. **Sankey** (1.5 min): "CNN → Coastal → Positive. Fox → Rural → Negative"
6. **Treemap** (1 min): "Texas dominates 40%"
7. **Network** (1.5 min): "These are echo chambers"
8. **Diverging** (1 min): "+0.6 vs -0.4 polarization"
9. **Causal Bias** (1.5 min): "True bias vs justified differences"

### Close (3 min)
**Critical question**: "If this platform could predict regional resistance 2 weeks before opposition campaigns emerge, would that be worth $75,000/year to [Organization]?"

**Follow-up**: "What features would make this a must-have vs nice-to-have?"

**Next steps**: "Let's do a 3-month pilot for $18,750. 10 custom analyses. If you don't see value, no commitment to annual contract. Fair?"
