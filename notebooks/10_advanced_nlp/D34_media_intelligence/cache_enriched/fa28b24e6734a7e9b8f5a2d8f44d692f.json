{"full_text": "Kate Keefer is a resident of the Riverton Community in Portland.\nPortland has a housing crisis, but we need to be precise about what that crisis actually is. The problem isn\u2019t housing quantity \u2014 it\u2019s housing affordability. According to Zillow, Portland currently has 271 rental units available. Yet only 28 of those units \u2014 slightly more than 10% \u2014 rent for under $1,800 per month.\nTo understand why this matters, consider the economics: Maine\u2019s median hourly wage is $24.19. A full-time worker at that wage can afford roughly $1,262 in monthly rent under thefederal standard established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that housing costs should not exceed 30% of income.\nA minimum wage worker earning $14.65/hour can afford just $762 per month. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition\u2019s 2025 Out of Reach report, a worker would need to earn $28.42 per hour \u2014 well above Maine\u2019s median wage \u2014 just to afford a two-bedroom apartment at fair market rent.\nThe result is that 53% of Maine renters are now cost-burdened, paying more than 30% of their income on housing \u2014 up from 32% just five years ago. There are only 52 affordable units available for every 100 extremely low-income households statewide. Yet the Portland Planning Board continues approving developments that barely address this reality.\nThe recently approved Belfort Landing project exemplifies the disconnect: 50 new units, with only 13 designated as \u201caffordable\u201d \u2014 just 25%. When nearly 90% of our rental housing need is for truly affordable units, building developments that are 75% market-rate doesn\u2019t solve the problem.Advertisement\nThis pattern isn\u2019t unique to Belfort Landing. Across Portland, market-rate and luxury housing dominates new construction because they are more profitable. The Planning Board approves these projects in the name of \u201cadding housing supply,\u201d while Portland\u2019s low- and middle-income families continue to be priced out.\nThe data are clear: we\u2019re not experiencing a housing shortage. We\u2019re experiencing an affordable housing shortage. Adding more expensive units to our inventory doesn\u2019t help the librarian, the barista, the electrician or the cop who can\u2019t find housing they can afford.\nThe Planning Board and City Council have tools to demand better. They can require substantially higher percentages of affordable units in new developments.\nThey can prioritize projects that serve demonstrated community needs over developer profit margins. They can ensure that \u201cadding housing\u201d actually means adding housing that working Portlanders can afford.\nUntil our city officials make this distinction and act on it, we\u2019ll continue building the wrong thing \u2014 adding units to our inventory while families leave Portland because they simply can\u2019t afford to stay.\nPortland deserves responsible development that serves its residents, not just its real estate market.\nCopy the Story Link\nTagged: columns", "extraction_method": "beautifulsoup", "word_count": 455, "success": true}
