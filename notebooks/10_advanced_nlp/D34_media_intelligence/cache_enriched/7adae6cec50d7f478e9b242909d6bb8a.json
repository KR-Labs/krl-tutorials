The housing affordability crisis is sparing no one. But rural America is feeling particular strain. In rural America, prices continue to rise and incomes haven't kept up, according to a new report from Redfin. The convergence of both factors is causing housing affordability to \"erode faster than big cities and suburbs.\"\u00a0Homeowners need an annual income of $74,508 to afford a median-priced home in rural U.S. counties, up a staggering 105.8% from before the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, rural buyers only needed to earn $36,206, according to Redfin's analysis, which compares the third quarter of 2025 with the third quarter of 2019. \u00a0 MORE THAN HALF OF US HOMES LOST VALUE OVER THE LAST YEAR The income needed to afford a median-priced home in suburban counties rose 90.9% to $102,120 during that same period. Previously, potential buyers only needed an annual salary of $53,482. The income needed to afford a home in urban counties climbed 87.5% to $118,300. Buyers needed an annual salary of $63,103 prior to the pandemic.\nA farm for sale in Rochester, Minnesota.\u00a0 (Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)A home is considered affordable if a buyer takes out a mortgage and spends no more than 30% of their income on their monthly housing payment, according to Redfin. \u00a0WHY ARE MORTGAGE RATES INCREASING DESPITE A RATE CUT FROM THE FED?\u00a0Home prices in rural areas have jumped considerably with the median sale price rising 60.5% from before the pandemic. Home sale prices are hovering around $280,900, which is a far cry from the $175,000 in 2019, according to the report. Meanwhile, the median household income in rural counties is sitting around $69,307, which is only up 33.3% from before the pandemic.\nA For-Sale sign is seen on the front lawn of a newly built house in Williston, North Dakota.\u00a0 (Andrew Burton / Getty Images)Sale prices in suburban counties jumped 48.9% to $385,000 while urban counties experienced a 46.2% gain with prices sitting at $446,000.

But during the pandemic, areas gained a lot of out-of-state prospective homebuyers. For instance, New Hampshire saw a growing interest from buyers in New York, Texas, California and Seattle, often with larger budgets. This allowed sellers to drive up the asking price, win bidding wars and purchase properties in the Lakes Region, according to New Hampshire-based Redfin Premier real estate agent Julia Martinage.\"A lot of those people are now moving back to where they came from and being replaced by locals or people from border states like Massachusetts,\" Martinage said.\nU.S. Stock Market Quotes\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nArrives Weekly\nGet Our Newsletter\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\nSubscribe\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.
