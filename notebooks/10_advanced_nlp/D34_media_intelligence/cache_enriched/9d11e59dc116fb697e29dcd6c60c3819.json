The move comes amid softer labor market conditions and a federal government shutdown that has stalled most economic data releases.\u201cFalling interest rates will help America\u2019s small businesses access the credit they need to capitalize on the strong economic momentum created by President Trump and Congressional Republicans\u2019 pro-growth policies,\u201d Job Creators Network CEO Alfredo Ortiz told the Daily Caller News Foundation. \u201cWith inflation tamed, gas prices at their lowest level in years, record stock market highs, and the Big Beautiful Bill\u2019s tax cuts fueling expansion, the economy is well-positioned for continued growth,\u201d Ortiz added. \u201cThis rate cut will empower small businesses to expand, hire, invest, and drive America\u2019s economic resurgence to even greater heights.\u201d (RELATED: SCOTT TURNER: At HUD, Homes and Healthcare Financing Are On The Line During Shutdown)\nUS Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks at a news conference at the Federal Reserve headquarters, following the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, on September 17, 2025.

The most recent available report, for August, showed just\u00a0 22,000 jobs added, while Bureau of Labor Statistics revisions revealed 911,000 fewer jobs created over the prior year than previously estimated.\nThe September employment report, typically released in early October, remains unpublished due to the shutdown. The only major data point issued since the impasse began was Friday\u2019s Consumer Price Index, which showed annual inflation rising 3% in September, below forecasts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, speaking on Oct. 14, acknowledged the data vacuum but noted the central bank continues to monitor an array of public and private-sector indicators, stating that the \u201coutlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting.\u201d Powell added that while recent economic data have come in stronger than expected, it hasn\u2019t yet translated into renewed hiring strength.\n\u201cYou do have a bit of tension between labor market data \u2013 we see very low levels of job creation \u2013 and yet people are spending,\u201d Powell said. \u201cWe are going to have to see how that plays out.\u201d Economists broadly anticipate a third quarter-point cut at the Fed\u2019s December meeting, which would bring the federal funds rate 0.75 percentage points lower by year-end than it stood in January. \u201cInflation has been surprisingly sticky, but is coming down and will continue to come down. Thus, a series of quarter-point cuts until the funds rate is approaching 3% seems appropriate,\u201d JD Foster, former chief economist at the Office of Management and Budget, told the DCNF. \u201cAs the economy appears to remain on pretty solid footing, there\u2019s no real need to move more quickly.\u201d Mortgage rates \u2014 which the Fed does not directly control but are strongly influenced by its actions \u2014 have already fallen in anticipation. Freddie Mac reported the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 6.19% as of Oct. 23, down from 6.5% a year earlier. Yet, further relief to homebuyers may be limited. \u201cMarkets are forward-looking and have already priced in the likelihood of additional cuts,\u201d Tobias Peter, co-director at the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s Housing Center, told the DCNF. \u201cRates have come down quite a bit from a year ago, so another quarter-point move may not shift the needle much.\u201d At around 6%, many existing homeowners remain locked into lower-rate mortgages and are reluctant to sell, constricting supply. Housing affordability has become a key focus for the Trump administration, as only 28% of homes in the market are affordable for the average household, according to Realtor.com. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated in September that the administration may declare a national housing emergency, while President Donald Trump has also floated ideas like eliminating capital gains taxes on home sales. Foster, however, voiced skepticism about such tax changes. \u201cFew home sellers pay capital gains tax because they roll their equity into their next home. And for those few who might face a tax, what happens? The same thing that happens whenever you cut the tax on an asset \u2014 the asset price rises,\u201d Foster said. \u201cThat\u2019s not making housing more affordable.\u201d Foster argued the most effective lever remains lower interest rates, saying, \u201cBring down mortgage rates and, over time, local housing markets will return to normal in terms of supply.\u201d Peter said that while many solutions to the affordable housing crisis must come from state and local governments, such as zoning reform, there are also meaningful steps that can be taken at the federal level. For example, he suggested that the Bureau of Land Management could sell land located within one to five miles of existing development. \u201cOver the span of 10 years, we think that could easily add up to a million new housing units,\u201d Peter said. He also urged the administration to use its bully pulpit to promote reforms such as reducing minimum lot sizes, lowering taxes for small-scale developers, and easing restrictions on manufactured homes, measures he said could significantly boost the housing supply.
