Homeownership rates fell in 2024 for the first time in eight years as soaring home prices made ownership unattainable for many, Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies found. As of early 2025, prices are up 60% nationwide since 2019 and still rising at a rate of 3.9% year over year, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index. Consequently, the U.S. median existing single-family home price hit a new high of $429,400 in 2025, according to the National Association of Realtors.\nHigh prices aren't the only problem. The rise in mortgage rates since 2020 has also increased the income required to afford a typical home. In January 2020, the average 30-year fixed mortgage was around 3.72%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Today, it's around 6.30%. A Bankrate market study estimates that to afford a typical home, the average American household will need to make $117,000, which can be out of reach for a lot of families.

Here are a few ways to lower your homeownership costs and make your dream of becoming a homeowner a reality. Look Into Home-Buying Assistance Programs Many federal, state and city programs often help with down payments, closing costs or lower interest rates for those who qualify. For example, FHA loans only require 3.5% down if you have at least a 580 credit score, and VA and USDA loans require no down payment as long as you meet the eligibility requirements.\nTrending: Backed by $300M+ in Assets and Microsoft's Climate Fund, Farmland LP Opens Vital Farmland III to Accredited Investors Consider Starter or Smaller Properties Condos, townhomes, manufactured homes or smaller single-family properties can be more affordable entry points. You can always move up later as your income grows. Expand Your Search Radius If you're flexible with where you want to live, consider expanding your search radius since prices can differ pretty dramatically just a few miles away. Look at up-and-coming neighborhoods, nearby suburbs or small towns within commuting distance. Housing in these areas is generally more affordable compared to the city center.\nLeer m\u00e1s\nSee Also: Maximize saving for your retirement and cut down on taxes: Schedule your free call with a financial advisor to start your financial journey \u2013 no cost, no obligation.
