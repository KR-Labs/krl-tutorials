Phase two went into effect in August 2023 and placed limits on security deposit maximums, requiring landlords to consider applications on a first-come first-served basis. \nAccording to the city\u2019s original roadmap for the process, city officials during phase three will consider addressing issues like monthly gross income screenings, no-cause evictions and application requirements. \n\u201cStability and affordability comes from community ownership, and our mission is to create those democratic communities that are permanently affordable and environmentally sustainable,\u201d Chazandra Kern, a project manager for SquareOne Villages, said. \u201cWith TOPA, we see it as one of those tools that opens up the prospects for renters to not only maintain that stability, but to become co-owners in the housing communities.\u201d \nIn Eugene, housing affordability and stability has been one of the top issues on residents\u2019 minds, according to Celine Swenson-Harris, chair of the Democratic Party of Lane County. \n\u201cWhen I am out knocking on doors, when I talk to volunteers who go out knocking on doors and come back and talk to me about the conversations they had, we see housing and affordability show up again and again. No matter where you are in this community, and across so many different age and income demographics, housing and homelessness is one of the topics that we hear pretty much every time,\u201d Swenson-Harris said. \nThe National Low Income Housing Coalition found that in Oregon, affordable rent for minimum wage-workers caps at $783 a month, but an average one-bedroom\u2019s fair market rent is $1,435 a month. According to Eugene housing stats from January, 51% of the city\u2019s population are renters, and 61% of them experience cost-burdens. \nAdvocates are hoping that the city council will consider TOPA for phase three of the renters protection process. \n  \n      \n \n \n \n   View Story Comments  \n \n \n \n 4    Like This Story   \n \n    Share on Facebook   \n \n    Share on X   \n \n    Email this Story   \n \n    Print this Story   \n  \n \n Leave a Comment   \n \n \nMore to Discover \n\n\n \n \n  \n \n More in community  \n \n \n \n \n    \n Just my cup of tea    \n \n \n \n    \n Matcha lattes and building community    \n \n \n \n    \n Take a step forward this Walktober    \n \n \n \n    \n Approximately 4,000 attend Eugene \u201cNo Kings 2\u201d protest    \n \n \n \n    \n Flock cameras to be paused within the next 24 hours    \n \n \n \n    \n Composting in Eugene      \n \n \n More in community-news  \n \n \n \n \n    \n Eugene Planning Commission backs code changes allowing taller new UO dorms in East Campus    \n \n \n \n    \n Health Enrichment for Low-Income Pets provides pet services to the Eugene community    \n \n \n \n    \n Volunteer groups hope to bridge gaps between UO and Eugene community    \n \n \n \n    \n Residents talk Flock, housing affordability at city council meeting    \n \n \n \n    \n ACLU lawsuit against Eugene renews debate over police surveillance    \n \n \n \n    \n House fire across from UO residence hall      \n \n \n More in News  \n \n \n \n \n    \n UO wellness center to take up previous Shake Smart location in Student Recreation Center    \n \n \n \n    \n Career Closet Pop-Up provides free professional attire for students    \n \n \n \n    \n UO professor arrested on child sex-abuse charges    \n \n \n \n    \n UO legal counsel explains ICE protocols and legal boundaries during faculty senate meeting    \n \n \n \n    \n Former SOJC Dean Juan-Carlos Molleda cleared of wrongdoing by state ethics commission    \n \n \n \n    \n UO students leverage AI to create college marketplace and housing-finder website        \n \nAbout the Contributors \n \n \n \n    \n \n Billie Corsetti, News Reporter  \n Billie is a news reporter at the Daily Emerald and a sophomore studying Journalism and Political Science.
