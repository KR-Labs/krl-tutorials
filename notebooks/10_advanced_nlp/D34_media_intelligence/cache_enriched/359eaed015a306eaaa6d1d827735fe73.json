While still the most expensive in the city, the roughly $5 million price tag represents a roughly 15% decrease from the $5.9 million median sales price in the second quarter of this year.Manhattan, which is home to six of the 10 most expensive neighborhoods, led all boroughs with a median sales price of $1,150,000 during the third quarter of the year, the same as during the third quarter of 2024.Brooklyn, which houses the fifth-, sixth-, seventh- and eighth-most expensive neighborhoods, had a median sales price of $916,000, roughly 11% higher than last year.Queens and the Bronx had median sales prices of $600,000 and $380,000, respectively, with 12 Queens neighborhoods and zero Bronx neighborhoods included in the top-50 most expensive across the city.Here\u2019s a look at the 10 most expensive neighborhoods in New York City.1) Hudson Yards, ManhattanMedian sales price Q3 2025: $4,999,000Median sales price Q3 2024: N/AYear-over-year change: N/A2) TriBeCa, ManhattanMedian sales price Q3 2025: $3,773,000Median sales price Q3 2024: $3,898,000Year-over-year change: -3%3) SoHo, ManhattanMedian sales price Q3 2025: $3,363,000Median sales price Q3 2024: $4,250,000Year-over-year change: -21%4) Hudson Square, ManhattanMedian sales price Q3 2025: $2,650,000Median sales price Q3 2024: $1,850,000Year-over-year change: +43%5) Cobble Hill, BrooklynMedian sales price Q3 2025: $2,275,000Median sales price Q3 2024: $1,840,000Year-over-year change: +24%6) DUMBO, BrooklynMedian sales price Q3 2025: $1,925,000Median sales price Q3 2024: $1,667,000Year-over-year change: +15%7) Fort Greene, BrooklynMedian sales price Q3 2025: $1,895,000Median sales price Q3 2024: $1,138,000Year-over-year change: +67%8) Boerum Hill, BrooklynMedian sales price Q3 2025: $1,833,000Median sales price Q3 2024: $1,596,000Year-over-year change: +15%9) Central Midtown, ManhattanMedian sales price Q3 2025: $1,723,000Median sales price Q3 2024: $970,000Year-over-year change: +78%10) Flatiron District, ManhattanMedian sales price Q3 2025: $1,713,000Median sales price Q3 2024: $1,750,000Year-over-year change: -2%More Data Stories:Number of Staten Islanders living in poverty drops more than 14% in past year, data showsNearby airport tops list of most likely to see Thanksgiving travel delaysRepublican voter registration hits record-high on Staten Island: See how many call the borough homeNearly 4K homes sold on Staten Island in past year; these neighborhoods saw the most salesWeekly wages fall on Staten Island; See which New York counties earn the mostErik BascomeErik Bascome is an award-winning public interest and advocacy reporter for the Staten Island Advance and SILive.com.
