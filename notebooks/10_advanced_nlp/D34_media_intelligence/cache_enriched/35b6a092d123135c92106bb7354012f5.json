And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.\n\nIt\u2019s a trend analysts say didn\u2019t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)\n\nIt\u2019s a trend analysts say didn\u2019t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.\n\nHow Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater Mortgages\n\nBeing \u201cunderwater\u201d on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate\u2019s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, \u201cyou owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed\u201d.\n\nBut according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022\u20132024 landed in that position almost immediately. That\u2019s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels \u2014 in exchange for higher home prices.\n\nHere\u2019s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:\n\n27% of Lennar\u2019s FHA loans from 2022\u20132024 are now underwater.\n18% of D.R. Horton\u2019s FHA loans are underwater.\n10% of Quicken Loans\u2019 FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.\n\nThe playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that\u2019s already near, or above, the home\u2019s actual value.\n\nWhen prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.\n\nWhat Happens When You\u2019re Underwater?\n\nFor homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.\n\nYou can\u2019t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.\nYou can\u2019t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.\nThe risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they\u2019re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.\nIt becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.\n\nIn short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.\n\nIs a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?\n\nInto this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.\n\nSupporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a \u201clifetime mortgage.\u201d\n\nThe Upside: Lower Payments\n\nLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)\n\nA 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.\n\nA New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250\u2013$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.\n\nLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.\n\nThe Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger Risks\n\nThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example:\n\n30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,000\n50-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000\n\nYou\u2019d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.\n\nThe National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they\u2019d be 86 by the time the loan matures.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry\u2019s lending incentives need a closer look.\n\nJOIN THE CONVERSATION (6)\n\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.\n\n\n\n\nTRENDING\n'It was a bit eerie': 73-year-old falls overboard on Disney Cruise, remains missing\nPolice identify teen motorcyclist killed in Henrietta crash\nFlorida man accused of killing his brothers in Allegany County hunting cabin\nDriver charged with DWI after vehicle crashes into St. Ambrose Church \nMonroe County Sheriff's Office investigating fatal crash on Jefferson Road in Henrietta\nNEWS IN PHOTOS:\n\"Local\"\n9\nPolice identify teen motorcyclist killed in Henrietta crash\n8\nHope Dealers BTC honors late Sister Grace Miller at Hopesgiving event in Rochester\n11\nRabbi Ben Goldstein joins Temple Beth El as new senior rabbi\n5\nDriver charged with DWI after vehicle crashes into St. Ambrose Church\nACCESSIBILITY\nDownload Our Mobile Apps:\nTerms & Conditions\nCopyright Notices\nPrivacy & Cookie Policy\nFCC Info\nFCC Applications\nContact\nPublic File Assistance\nNews Team\nContests\nDiversity & Inclusion\nNews\nWeather\nSports\nTraffic\nHealth Matters\nGame Center\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nDo Not Sell or Share\nCookie Preferences\n\n 2025 Sinclair, Inc.", "extraction_method": "jina", "word_count": 1069, "success": true}
