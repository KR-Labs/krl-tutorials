Airy. POWER Interfaith\u2019s goal is to pressure City Council into intensifying efforts to address the current housing affordability crisis Philadelphia residents are facing. \nFaith leaders specifically focused on City Council\u2019s June 12 decision to gradually reduce Business Income and Receipt Tax (BIRT), citing potential harm to the city\u2019s working class and most vulnerable residents. \nThe BIRT tax is the third-largest source of tax revenue for the city, paid for by business owners or companies engaged in for-profit activity within the City of Philadelphia. The tax is not levied on residents who are not business owners. \n\u201cCutting business taxes is estimated to cost the city $2.8 billion over 12 years, removing significant dollars from the city budget and forcing residents to shoulder more of the burden,\u201d Jayson Massey, a member of Germantown Friends Meeting, said at a press conference Saturday outside Germantown High School. \nHe added, \u201cWe are here today in front of the former Germantown High School to show the crisis of affordable housing in Germantown, and also to show that the loss of Germantown High School did not result in usable, safe, and affordable housing for the residents here in Germantown. This neighborhood, with a median income of only $45,727, does not need luxury apartments.\u201d \nThe high school building, which closed in 2013, has been converted into an apartment complex called The Annex at Germantown, where rents begin at $1,050 for studio apartments, according to rent.com. \nAlong with Germantown and Greene Street Friends Meeting, Northwest faith groups and congregations joining the initiative to lobby for affordable housing include St.Vincent de Paul Catholic Church, Faith Chapel, Face to Face Germantown, Mishkan Shalom synagogue, First United Methodist Church of Germantown (FUMCOG), Second Baptist Church of Germantown, and Unitarian Universalists of Mt. Airy. \n\n      \n \nOn Wednesday, Nov. 12, FUMCOG co-hosted one of the press conferences, with their senior pastor, the Rev. Alisa Lasater Wailoo, speaking on the issue of affordability. \n\u201cWhen I arrived here about three years ago, I would say we got about two calls a week for folks in need. We\u2019re now getting about a dozen calls a week, easily,\u201d Wailoo said. \u201cWe get calls from young mothers. And it\u2019s not just calls, members of our church, we have seniors who don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to be able to turn on their heat. We have veterans who wonder about their medical bills. And we have working folks of every race, every gender, every orientation, and background that are struggling.\u201d \nAt Saturday\u2019s press conference in front of Germantown High School, several speakers and attendees joined the group of faith and civic leaders including City Councilmember Nicolas O\u2019Rourke and Seth Anderson-Oberman, who ran against Councilmember Cindy Bass in 2023. \nO\u2019Rourke, along with fellow Working Families Party City Councilmember Kendra Brooks, opposed the decision to phase out the BIRT tax. \n\u201cThere are very few issues that are as constant as the cost of housing and the terms on which you secure it,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cThe city\u2019s widest housing gap is the shortage of almost 65,000 units, affordable and available to those with the lowest incomes. That\u2019s a problem.\u201d \nHe then discussed what he described as a weakness in Mayor Cherelle Parker\u2019s housing plan. \n\u201cThe mayor\u2019s plan for housing, which I have said, and I will say again, does have its fair share of bright spots \u2026 But something a number of my colleagues and I have raised was the importance of codifying that most of the plan\u2019s funding goes towards those making the least. Codifying it, not just stating an intention but writing that intent into the letter of the law,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cThe administration flatly refused to do this a couple of times.\u201d \nHe added, \u201cWe know there\u2019s no housing gap for luxury apartments. You see them all over the place, and they\u2019re good and empty \u2026 Everyone further up the income scale has a unit that\u2019s available to them, though it may not be their dream apartment. It may not be the exact thing that they\u2019re looking for; it may not hit all of their preferences. It may not be the perfect setup, but they can\u2019t afford it. With this in mind, I simply don\u2019t see why we aren\u2019t being clear about working for those who simply don\u2019t have an option that they can afford.\u201d \nKadi Ashby, the president of the Alden Park Tenants Association, shared her experience as a tenant. When she organized the tenants group early this year, Ashby and her neighbors fought for better maintenance and responsiveness from their building\u2019s management company. \nAfter months of organizing, she received an email from property management denying her a lease renewal, without providing a reason. \n\u201cI am left unable to afford to move. I\u2019m unable to find a comparable apartment in my neighborhood, and it\u2019s possible that this will force me out of my community, the community that, through all of this, has shown me overwhelming support,\u201d Ashby said. \u2018We need all of our city council members to commit to fighting gentrification and the corporate landlords taking over our neighborhoods.\u201d \nOne goal of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s office has been to push for better protections for renters, including a bill that would require \u201cgood cause\u201d for denying a lease renewal. This effort would protect tenants who attempted to organize from retaliation. \nAnderson-Oberman, who is currently the executive director of the advocacy group Reclaim Philadelphia, ran on a progressive platform, narrowly losing to Bass in the 2023 Democratic primary. On Saturday, he discussed his own family\u2019s struggle with affordability and the actions he believes the city must take to address the housing crisis. \n\u201cThe private sector alone, the so-called free market, is never going to solve this crisis. If the private sector were going to build deeply affordable housing for working-class families, they would have done it already,\u201d Anderson-Oberman said. \u201cThat\u2019s why our government \u2014 city, state, and federal \u2014 must step in and build the housing that we actually need. We need public investment. We need government-funded social housing that is mixed-income and permanently affordable.\u201d \nWork ahead \nOn Feb. 1, Power Interfaith will host a Citywide Affordability Summit, inviting City Councilmembers to speak with faith leaders, advocates, and residents about a long-term solution to the shortage of affordable housing and other affordability issues. \nReflecting on the week of press conferences, Meg Cruz, the Northwest organizer for POWER Interfaith, told the Local, \u201cI think it was a super powerful week of action where we saw over 20 of our congregations who were represented at these different press conferences. We had everyday people speaking out about how the affordability crisis impacted them and what the implications of this loss of [BIRT] funding would be like.\u201d \nShe added, \u201cThis is a crisis that is really escalating at a scale that is impossible for people to withstand within their own means, and the decision to eliminate business taxes makes that worse.\u201d \nTommy Tucker can be reached at Tommy@Chestnuthilllocal.com.  \n \n                            \n \n Other items that may interest you  \n \n \n \n  Faith leaders call for housing affordability and a \u2026    \n \n \n  Community leaders react to mayor\u2019s new \u2026    \n \n \n  St. Martin-in-the-Fields helps resettle Afghan family    \n \n \n  New executive director of Bird in Hand strives for \u2026         \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n      \n \n \n      \n \n \n      \n \n \n      \n \n \nLocal Calendar \n    \n \n \n      \n \n \n      \n \n \n      \n \n \nThe Latest  \n \nA tribute to Rabbi Waskow Recently, I became aware of the passing of author, social activist Rabbi Arthur Waskow, who packed a lot of punch into his 92 years. \n  \n \n     \nRichard Allen Lane Station is a model of success The Richard Allen Lane Station was the first site along the Chestnut Hill West line to be leased to Ken Weinstein more than 20 years ago.
