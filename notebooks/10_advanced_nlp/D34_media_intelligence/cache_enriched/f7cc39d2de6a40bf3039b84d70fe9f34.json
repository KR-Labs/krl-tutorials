V\u00e1squez)\nSan Francisco pushes bold housing plan to tackle affordability crisis\nThe Associated Press//October 30, 2025//\nListen to this article\nThe Blueprint\nMayor Daniel Lurie proposes denser housing to ease San Francisco\u2018s affordability crisis.\nThe plan would allow taller buildings citywide, including historic areas.\nCritics fear displacement and loss of neighborhood character.\nThe state is pressuring San Francisco to approve 36,000 new homes by 2031.\nSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie is trying to get more homes built for people like Liam Murphy: a fifth-generation city kid who found himself repeatedly outbid for tiny two-bedroom houses that wound up selling for $1.6 million.\nMurphy, 39, now lives about an hour\u2019s drive away from his job as a San Francisco firefighter. He says it\u2019s too late for his family to move back, but he hopes others can stay in a city where the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom is $3,500.\n\u201cThat would just make for a better city overall,\u201d said Murphy, \u201cand the reason is because city kids just grow up being exposed to more. They\u2019re exposed to all the cultures of San Francisco, which makes a more well-rounded person.\u201d\nTiny, colorful San Francisco \u2014 just seven miles squared \u2014 embraces its image as a city that welcomes all. But its inability to build more housing has made it one of the world\u2019s toughest places to find a home, risking the diversity it prides itself on.\nEpithets are hurled at the mayor\nLurie hopes to change that, with a plan to allow for denser and taller buildings throughout much of the city, including the westside Sunset neighborhood of single-family homes and the tourist friendly Haight-Ashbury, which is studded with classic Victorian and Edwardian homes.\nThe issue has roiled the city, and threats of recall loom over San Francisco supervisors who go along with Lurie. At a recent housing rally, the mayor who won a rare reprieve from President Donald Trump\u2019s threats to send in federal forces struggled to be heard over angry chants of \u201cshame!\u201d and \u201cliar.\u201d\nProtesters demanded the city invest in 100% below-market rate housing and accused him of being a gentrifier and a Republican.\n\u201cI truly believe that this has San Franciscans\u2019 best interests at heart. Are some people going to be fearful? Absolutely. I get it. Change is scary,\u201d said Lurie, who is a centrist Democrat. \u201cBut the status quo is not working. There\u2019s an affordability crisis right now.\u201d\nDemocrats vs. Democrats\nThe city\u2019s estimated 830,000 residents are passionate over both land use and equity. Housing projects have died as pressure to create more affordable units made potential developments unprofitable. Residents also want their stunning views.\nBut San Francisco is under pressure from the state to adopt a new zoning plan allowing for 36,000 more homes by 2031 \u2014 or else the state will decide what gets built where \u2014 and the mayor likely has the votes to pass his \u201cFamily Zoning Plan.\u201d\nSupporters say it\u2019s a matter of supply and demand, and that more homes will bring down the overall cost of housing.\nCritics say such trickle-down economics will not work in a city like San Francisco, which is in such global demand that some foreign investors buy properties sight-unseen. They say developers will only build luxury housing that\u2019s too costly for most workers, while displacing tenants and destroying the character of entire neighborhoods.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a herd of elephants in the room that no one will address,\u201d says Eric Jaye, a Democratic political consultant who opposes the plan.\nA city \u2018for people who didn\u2019t love cities\u2019\nMuch of the housing push has come from Democrats, including a former city mayor, Gov. Gavin Newsom, who signed into law a proposal by San Francisco state Sen. Scott Wiener to build more homes near transit.\nThe city has made enormous strides in recent years, with whole districts of tall condo buildings cropping up around downtown, says Rafael Mandelman, president of the Board of Supervisors. But he acknowledges that people come to San Francisco for its more intimate neighborhoods and access to green space.\n\u201cSan Francisco, historically, was the city for people who didn\u2019t love cities,\u201d Mandelman said.\nKatherine Roberts, 72, initially welcomed construction of an affordable housing complex near the three-story Edwardian she labored to buy in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood two decades ago.\nBut at 160 units and eight stories high, the massive building has shattered her peace of mind, dominating her view.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking out and it\u2019s like I\u2019m living in East Germany. How can you build something this inappropriate in a historic neighborhood like the Haight-Ashbury?\u201d Roberts said. \u201cWhat about all the people who already live here? What are we supposed to do?\u201d\nProposal calls for denser homes\nFor the most part, the new zoning plan allows for more housing to be packed into the space of a single-family home \u2014 say a duplex with a studio \u2014 without exceeding the city\u2019s height limit of roughly four stories for such properties. At least 15% of new housing must be below-market rate.\nBuildings on neighborhood commercial corridors could double to eight stories. Busier thoroughfares could see high-rises of 10 stories and more, and in a few spots, on Van Ness Avenue, heights could hit 650 feet, rivaling some downtown skyscrapers.\nPassage of Lurie\u2019s proposal won\u2019t necessarily lead to more homes in a city with high labor and construction costs and \u201cnotoriously complex and cumbersome\u201d approval processes, as the state said in a scathing 2023 review.\nAnd so city dwellers make do with overcrowded \u2014 and sometimes awkward \u2014 living situations.\nLaura Foote, executive director of \u201cyes in my backyard\u201d YIMBY Action, wound up living with the man who is now her husband \u2014 and the woman he was divorcing \u2014 in a one-bedroom apartment for about six months, until his ex could find another rental.\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t kill each other,\u201d Foote said, \u201cbut it went on longer than it would have in a well-functioning housing market.\u201d\nMayor\u2019s plan is likely to pass\nSupervisors are still negotiating amendments to the zoning plan, which could be voted out of committee on Monday for consideration by the full board. Some supervisors want to exempt historic properties, or all buildings currently used for housing. The mayor agreed to exempt buildings with at least three rent-controlled units.\nThe compromise was a major relief for Phyllis Nabhan, 78, who lives in the Richmond neighborhood, between the Golden Gate Bridge and Golden Gate Park. She fears becoming homeless if a developer scoops up the property she\u2019s called home for 47 years, starting with a rent of just $350 a month.\nBut Nabhan still objects to the proposal. She says it would ruin her neighborhood\u2019s \u201ccozy and wonderful\u201d feel, and blames the state for forcing the city to change.\n\u201cI think that this mayor is trying,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible job, I wouldn\u2019t want to be mayor.\u201d\nTags:\ndevelopment, California housing crisis, housing plan, Daniel Lurie, Real Estate, YIMBY, San Francisco, Gavin Newsom, zoning, affordable housing\nRelated Articles\nWellington buys air rights for rentals over Native American clinic\nSt. Paul tackles rezoning for Hamm\u2019s site redevelopment\nRochester buys $2.7M site for new fire station plan\nReport shows economic distress puts affordable homes at risk\nIron District development plan includes soccer stadium\nShare this!\nRelated ContentJO Companies eyes new affordable housing in Brooklyn ParkJO Companies is planning up to 160 affordable units on Brooklyn Boulevard in Brooklyn Park, seeking public fun[...]November 24, 2025Wisconsin bill could make way for sprinklers in older housingA new Wisconsin bill would let local governments mandate sprinklers and fire-prevention upgrades in older hous[...]November 24, 2025Alaska Native villages weight costly relocation optionsStorms, erosion and thawing permafrost are putting Alaska Native villages at risk as communities weigh costly [...]November 24, 2025Supply chain delays, rising prices threaten electricity gridTransformer, circuit breaker, and cable shortages threaten U.S. grid reliability as demand surges from AI, ele[...]November 24, 2025Endeavor plans redevelopment at former Totino\u2019s siteEndeavor Development plans to replace a Fridley bakery with a 250,000-square-foot speculative warehouse, pendi[...]November 21, 2025Q&A: Kim Hofstede steps in as president of Founders PropertiesNew Founders Properties president Kim Hofstede discusses her career path, industrial real estate strategy, mar[...]November 21, 2025\nFinance & Commerce Daily Newsletter\nSign up for your daily digest of Minnesota News.\nBy signing up you agree to our\nPrivacy Policy\nUpcoming business events\nSee the full list of events here\nEditor\u2019s Picks\nJO Companies eyes new affordable housing in Brooklyn Park\n11/24/2025\nEndeavor plans redevelopment at former Totino\u2019s site\n11/21/2025\nQ&A: Kim Hofstede steps in as president of Founders Properties\n11/21/2025\nMakado buys two Richfield apartment properties\n11/20/2025\nMinnesota groups fight HUD cuts to supportive housing\n11/20/2025\nNews\nEden Prairie flex industrial building sells for $14 million\nA 93K-square-foot flex industrial building in Eden Prairie\u2019s Golden Triangle has sold for $14M as [...]\nJO Companies eyes new affordable housing in Brooklyn Park\nJO Companies is planning up to 160 affordable units on Brooklyn Boulevard in Brooklyn Park, seeking [...]\nWisconsin bill could make way for sprinklers in older housing\nA new Wisconsin bill would let local governments mandate sprinklers and fire-prevention upgrades in [...]\nAlaska Native villages weight costly relocation options\nStorms, erosion and thawing permafrost are putting Alaska Native villages at risk as communities wei[...]\nIPO market stalls as shutdown and investor caution rise\nA government shutdown, SEC backlog and investor caution have slowed IPOs, sending recent debuts lowe[...]\nSupply chain delays, rising prices threaten electricity grid\nTransformer, circuit breaker, and cable shortages threaten U.S. grid reliability as demand surges fr[...]\nBattery limits, safety issues pose challenges to flying taxis\nChina\u2019s low-altitude economy is booming as drones and eVTOL flying taxis expand, though battery li[...]\nUN climate deal boosts funding but skips fossil fuel cuts\nCOP30 ends with a funding boost for climate adaptation but no pledge to phase out fossil fuels, prom[...]\nEndeavor plans redevelopment at former Totino\u2019s site\nEndeavor Development plans to replace a Fridley bakery with a 250,000-square-foot speculative wareho[...]\nJust Sold: North Lakes uses apartment sale for new project\nNorth Lakes Property Management sells four Minnesota apartments to three buyers to help finance a ne[...]\nSpecial Publications\nFinance & Commerce\u2019s Top Women in Finance 2025 profiles\n11/14/2025\nRising Young Professionals honorees announced\n10/14/2025\nFinance & Commerce announces Minnesota Icon honorees\n10/14/2025\nIn the Lead: Women-Owned Businesses 2025\n9/30/2025\nBeyond The Skyline Podcast\nBeyond the Skyline is a podcast and video interview about economic development, real estate and construction in Minnesota.\nListen here\nNews\nEvents\nWebinars\nPodcast\nPublic Notices\nAbout\nFAQ\nSubscribe\nSubmit a public notice\nPress Releases\nProfessional Announcements\nBTM Business Connect\nBehind the Deal\nContributor Content\nAdvertising\nABOUT\nFinance & Commerce provides news, analysis and commentary on Minnesota business.
