After peaking at around $1.25 million in mid-2022, the price of a typical home has fallen to roughly $1.14 million (as of September).THIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLYSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.Unlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.Get exclusive access to the Vancouver Sun ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.Enjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.Support local journalists and the next generation of journalists.Daily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.SUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLESSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.Unlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.Get exclusive access to the Vancouver Sun ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.Enjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.Support local journalists and the next generation of journalists.Daily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.REGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLESCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.Access articles from across Canada with one account.Share your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.Enjoy additional articles per month.Get email updates from your favourite authors.THIS ARTICLE IS FREE TO READ REGISTER TO UNLOCK.Create an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.Access articles from across Canada with one accountShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the commentsEnjoy additional articles per monthGet email updates from your favourite authorsSign In or Create an AccountEmail AddressContinueor View more offersIf you are a Home delivery print subscriber, online access is included in your subscription.\nActivate your Online Access NowArticle contentThat\u2019s a meaningful drop, yet homes still cost far more than what many families can afford. Without reforms that reduce costs and delays for homebuilders, Metro\u2019s housing crisis will continue.Article contentArticle contentArticle contentTo illustrate the scale of the problem, consider what buying a home in Metro looks like for a middle-income family. According to a new study published by the Fraser Institute, in 2023 (the latest year of comparable data), the annual median after-tax income for a family in Metro was $64,660 while the price of a typical home \u2014 \u00a0meaning a home of any type (detached, townhouse, condo, etc.) with common characteristics and amenities \u2014 was $1.17 million.Article contentThere was an error, please provide a valid email address.Sign UpThanks for signing up!A welcome email is on its way.

Metro was Canada\u2019s second least-affordable area for renters in 2023 (again, the latest year of comparable data), with the median rental unit costing $1,715 per month \u2014 or 31.8 per cent of the median after-tax family income \u2014 up from $1,035 (26.3 per cent) a decade earlier in 2014.Article contentArticle contentAnd there\u2019s more bad news. While the recent decline in house prices hasn\u2019t been enough to meaningfully improve affordability, it has made it harder for builders to cover their costs, prompting a steep contraction in homebuilding at a time when the city needs more new homes.Article contentRead More\nMost Vancouverites believe the city\u2019s 'brand' is in decline.

Despite hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars spent on housing initiatives by the federal government, the Eby government and Metro municipalities, including the City of Vancouver, provincial and municipal policies continue to impose needless costs, delays and restrictions on homebuilding.Article contentFor example, municipal approvals for new housing projects take twice as long in Vancouver (7.7 months) as they do in Edmonton (3.4 months) or Regina (3.2 months), owing to a complex and time-consuming permitting process.Advertisement 1This advertisement has not loaded yet.Trending Saskatchewan firm's plan to export through Washington state instead of B.C. has David Eby fuming\nColumnists\nVancouver couple's Dungeons and Dragons invention hits viral success\nNews\nAdvertisement 2Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

These policies add costs and delays that deter homebuilding, especially when falling prices are already squeezing developer margins.Article contentOf course, some factors remain beyond the control of local policy-makers.Article contentFor example, federal immigration policy, particularly over the last five years, has greatly increased demand for homes in the Lower Mainland and across Canada.Article contentBut here\u2019s a fact \u2014 builders would build more homes in Metro, despite falling prices, if not for lengthy approval processes and costly government fees. To help improve housing affordability in Metro, municipalities in the district must remove unnecessary barriers to development.Article contentTegan Hill and Austin Thompson are analysts at the Fraser Institute.Article contentShare this article in your social network\nShare this Story : Opinion: Local policies contribute to Metro Vancouver\u2019s housing affordability woes\nCopy Link\nEmail\nX\nReddit\nPinterest\nLinkedIn\nTumblr CommentsYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.Create an AccountSign in\nJoin the Conversation Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.
