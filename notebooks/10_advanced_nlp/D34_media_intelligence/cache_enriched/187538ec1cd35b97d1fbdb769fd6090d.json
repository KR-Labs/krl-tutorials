Redfin agreed to transition clients to Zillow, incentivize its own sales staff to do the same, and display only Zillow's listings for large rental properties on its platforms.Prosecutors say this deal allowed Zillow to solidify its position as the dominant player in the multifamily rental listings market\u2014at the expense of competition and consumer choice. Shortly after the agreement, Redfin reportedly laid off around 450 employees and shut down its rental listing operations.Attorneys general from Arizona, Connecticut, New York, and Virginia joined Washington in filing the suit. They allege the companies violated both the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Clayton Act by unlawfully eliminating competition and engaging in an anti-competitive acquisition.SEE ALSO | Amid housing affordability troubles, nearly 60% of young adults are 'rent burdened'The lawsuit seeks a court order to unwind the agreement and restore competition in the online rental marketplace.The Federal Trade Commission also filed a related complaint against Zillow and Redfin in the same court.According to the lawsuit, Zillow began building its rental listings platform in the 2010s and expanded aggressively through acquisitions of rival platforms like HotPads and Trulia. Redfin, which entered the rental listing market in 2021 by acquiring RentPath\u2014owner of Rent.com, ApartmentGuide.com, and Rentals.com\u2014had competed fiercely until the two companies struck the deal in early 2025.Comment with BubblesREAD THE COMMENTS (10)As of Wednesday, neither Zillow nor Redfin had issued a public response to the lawsuits.TrendingWashington state crackdown uncovers 41 unlicensed contractors in two-day operationIn a sweeping two-day enforcement operation, the Washington State Department of Labor & Industries (L&I) uncovered 41 cases of unlicensed contractors.
