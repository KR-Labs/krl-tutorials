The median home price in August was $413,000, up from $321,000 during the same month in 2020 \u201a\u00c4\u00ee a 28% increase, according to federal data.\nTo better understand this strain on some families, CNN turned to a home ownership affordability index published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. It measures the affordability for median-income households across the US who are hoping to buy a median-priced home in a given area.\nThe index compares the actual median household income to the \u201a\u00c4\u00faqualified\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 income needed to keep annual housing costs at or below 30%.\nAn index score of 100 or higher indicates the median household income is enough to afford the median-priced home based at that threshold. A score less than 100 means the median income is not enough for a median-priced home.\nCNN is tracking this index as it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s periodically updated by the Atlanta Fed. Look up your area to see the trends over time \u201a\u00c4\u00ee\u201a\u00c4\u00d8and how they compare with the national average.\nThe Atlanta Fed\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s housing data is available at both the national level and for individual core-based statistical areas, or CBSAs. It\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s updated monthly, though there\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s typically a two-month lag \u201a\u00c4\u00ee mainly because of the time it takes to record and collect home sales deeds. In some regions, the data can show noticeable fluctuations due to seasonal changes in median home prices or shifts in the volume of sales used to calculate those medians.\nThe Atlanta Fed\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s data comes from its Home Ownership Affordability Monitor, or HOAM. It factors in the monthly principal and interest cost, given the current mortgage interest rates, as well as taxes, property insurance and private mortgage insurance in the total cost of home ownership.\n\u201a\u00c4\u00faThe HOAM index is designed to easily track affordability over time in the United States across geographies,\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 said Domonic Purviance, a real estate expert with the Atlanta Fed who helped develop the tool.\nThe center of gravity on affordability has shifted dramatically across the country during the last five years, according to a CNN analysis of the data.\nMost metropolitan areas are now on the more expensive side of the threshold.\nThis nationwide shift varies by region.\nToday, most metropolitan areas in the West, for example, are too expensive for the median household under the income threshold. The Midwest has gotten dramatically more expensive, too.\nHomes\nEconomy\nFederal agencies\nSee all topics\nFacebook\nTweet\nEmail\nLink\nLink Copied!\nFollow", "extraction_method": "beautifulsoup", "word_count": 429, "success": true}
