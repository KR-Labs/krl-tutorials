That\u2019s the third largest month-over-month decline among markets, trailing only Canada\u2019s two largest markets.Article contentToronto topped the list with a decline of $9,400 to reach an average price in September of $960,300. In Vancouver, the cost fell $8,300 to about $1.14 million for the average cost of a home.Article contentThe price decline in Calgary was the key driver behind the decrease in the average monthly mortgage payment of $2,908, a drop of $30 from the previous month.Article contentFalling prices also lowered the amount of income to qualify under the federal stress test. It fell $1,100 to $123,200 in September from August to qualify for a rate of 6.47 per cent. That is a slight drop from August when the rate was 6.49 per cent. Both rates are two full percentage points above the posted mortgage rates for a five-year fixed rate used in the study. Borrowers must qualify at that highest threshold to ensure they can afford to pay their mortgage if interest rates rise.Article contentArticle contentAs well, Ratehub.ca calculated income requirements and mortgage payments based on a 10 per cent down payment.Article contentGraham notes that the drop in price and rates \u201cdid not really move the affordability dial\u201d for those most affected by affordability challenges, first-time buyers.Article contentYet the study does point to a shift in Calgary\u2019s resale real estate market, she adds.Article content\u201cCalgary had been a seller\u2019s market for quite some time, which started to unwind over the past couple of months,\u201d she says. \u201cThat sales-to-new-listings ratio actually dropped\u201d nearly nine percentage points in September. Calgary Real Estate Board statistics from Sept. 30 show the metric was 45 per cent, indicating a market with a balance between supply and demand. Yet the market has been trending toward favouring buyers as the ratio moves closer to 40 per cent, the threshold between a balanced and a buyer\u2019s market, Graham says.Advertisement 1This advertisement has not loaded yet.Trending Braid: UCP performing major surgery on Alberta health care\nColumnists\nCalgary lands 14 spots on 2025 Canada Top 100 Restaurants list\nLocal News\nAdvertisement 1Story continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.

Miller notes their interest rates are largely determined by the bond market, which often moves in anticipation of central bank moves, among other economic factors.Article contentMiller adds that as of late October rates had already moved, with the lowest for a five-year fixed rate at about 3.79 per cent.Article content\u201cThat increases your purchasing power by about $25,000\u201d based on the average price in Calgary, she says, noting that could help some first-time buyers.Article contentYet for the market to see significant growth, the Bank of Canada would likely need to cut rates more, Graham says.Article content\u201cIf the overnight lending rate went to two per cent, which we haven\u2019t seen since 2022, that would still be\u201d higher than during the pandemic.Article contentArticle contentShare this article in your social network\nShare this Story : Declining prices, interest rates improve housing affordability\nCopy Link\nEmail\nX\nReddit\nPinterest\nLinkedIn\nTumblr CommentsYou must be logged in to join the discussion or read more comments.Create an AccountSign in\nJoin the Conversation Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.
