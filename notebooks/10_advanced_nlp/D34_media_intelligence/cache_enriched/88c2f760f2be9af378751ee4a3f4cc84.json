Since the initial announcement, the proposal has drawn widespread criticism from both sides of the political aisle.\nWe hear you. We are laser focused on ensuring the American Dream for YOUNG PEOPLE and that can only happen on the economic level of homebuying. A 50 Year Mortgage is simply a potential weapon in a WIDE arsenal of solutions that we are developing right now. STAY TUNED!\nRecommended\nAdvertisement\nWe hear you.

STAY TUNED!\n\u2014 Pulte (@pulte) November 9, 2025\nThe goal of the 50-year mortgage would be to lower monthly payments; however, the reported decrease in a homebuyer\u2019s monthly cost would be minimal, while the total amount paid in interest would increase substantially. Regardless, President Trump has heard the voice of the American people and is actively exploring options to ensure that younger generations of Americans can still afford a home and achieve their American Dream.\nEditor\u2019s Note: After more than 40 days of screwing Americans, a few Dems have finally caved.
