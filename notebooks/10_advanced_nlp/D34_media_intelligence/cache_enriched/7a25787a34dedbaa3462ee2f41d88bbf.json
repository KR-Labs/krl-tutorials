 \n \n \n \n Spokane Public Radio    \n\n Published October 1, 2025 at 7:00 AM PDT     \n  \n    \n    \n       Listen \u2022 1:16       \n \n        \n \n\nBrandon Whitmarsh presentation to Spokane Plan Commission (public record) \nPhotos from the early 1900s show how prevalent single occupant units, otherwise known as rooms for rent, used to be.    \n \n \nAs Washington tries to create more housing for the future, it\u2019s finding inspiration from the past.\nIt\u2019s going to get easier to build boarding house-style buildings in Spokane.\nThat type of housing is now called co-living, and it\u2019s what Washington state is requiring all its cities to allow more of.\n\u201cCo-living is a kind of residential development where you have the individual sleeping units which are rentable as individual units, but they do share the cooking facilities,\" said Spokane city planner Brandon Whitmarsh.\nWhitmarsh told the plan commission last week that this isn\u2019t a new idea.\n\u201cThis is a housing type that was historically very common, similar to middle housing in the late 1800s, early 1900s as the city was experiencing a significant population boom,\" he said.\nThis kind of housing fell out of vogue after World War II.\nNow the state is looking to bring co-living back.\nOlympia says every city must allow co-living anywhere it allows housing with six units or more.\nIn Spokane, that\u2019s almost everywhere within city limits. That could mean more housing options for people who make below the area median income, or AMI.\n\u201cThis is the type of housing that throughout the state, the Department of Commerce is saying is seen at the market rate level to be affordable to households as low as 50% AMI,\" Whitmarsh said. \"So, just recognizing that this has the potential to aid in filling that need without having [subsidies] like those 1590 funds or some other form of subsidized housing.\u201d\n1590 funds are local sales tax revenues that are used to subsidize housing.\nThe city will update its code to be in line with state law by the end of the year.\n     \n Regional News  \n  \n    \n    \n \n \n  \n     \n  \n     \n  \n         \n  \n \n \n\n \nStay Connected \n \n instagram  \n facebook     \n\u00a9 2025 Spokane Public Radio.  \n  \n \n \n \n Privacy    \n \n \n EEO Information    \n \n \n FCC Public Inspection Files    \n \n \n About    \n \n \n Contact", "extraction_method": "jina", "word_count": 869, "success": true}
