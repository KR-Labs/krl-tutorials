GRACE CHEN / THE DAILY PENNSYLVANIAN\nBy COSTA GAY-AFENDULIS\nNov. 3, 2025\n\nPenn\u2019s Architecture department hosted a panel at the Weitzman School of Design to discuss the practice of adaptively converting vacant office buildings into residential units in cities.\n\nThe Oct. 29 panel included six experts in the field with backgrounds in architecture, journalism, and finance who spoke about the benefits and considerations of applying adaptive reuse on a large scale. This practice has gained traction in recent years as a way to bring life back to central business districts following a shift to remote work that has emptied out many American downtowns and the rapidly growing demand for housing.\u00a0\n\nWeitzman associate professor of practice Hina Jamelle, who also serves as the school\u2019s urban housing director, organized the event. During the panel, she explained that there has been \u201ca renewed attention on adaptive reuse, especially the conversion of commercial buildings into housing.\u201d\n\nJamelle added that the event\u2019s title, \u201cUnder Pressure\u201d, refers to \u201ca call for action in a timely and efficient way, because [they] realize that pressure has come to bear on certain aspects of the city.\u201d She emphasized that the housing crisis is relevant to Penn students because \u201cthe chances are very high\u201d that many of them are \u201cgoing to be moving to an urban center\u201d upon graduation.\n\n\u201cEveryone needs a place to live,\u201d she said. \u201cWe would not want cities to just be for sort of a certain asset class. You really want a city to have that engaging vibrancy of younger people coming in, new ideas coming in, and people being able to thrive.\u201d\u00a0\n\nWeitzman city and regional planning professor Vincent Reina, who worked as an urban housing policy advisor in the Biden-Harris administration, sat on the panel. He emphasized a need for \u201cactual affordable units,\u201d given that there is an estimated \u201cshortage of 65,000 affordable, available housing units\u201d in the city.\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf you look at the housing stock in Philadelphia, we actually have enough housing for most households,\u201d he said during the event. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have enough housing for the very poor households.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The Daily Pennsylvanian, Reina said that solving these issues in the city \u201crequires a real and consistent commitment from the city to address the housing needs, but particularly for the most vulnerable residents\u201d.\u00a0\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nReina has prior experience working with students on public housing projects in New York City, which he said \u201cspurred\u201d him to think about \u201cthe critical role that housing plays\u201d in helping residents feel that they are \u201ca part of the community.\u201d\n\nReina told the DP that his team helped develop PHL Housing Plus, a project to rehabilitate homes for affordability, and other Philadelphia initiatives such as Rebuilding Together.\u00a0\n\nArchitecture student Ryan Newbling emphasized the importance of having urban \u201cspace that really connects and drives a community, versus just having repetitive residential units,\u201d in an interview with the DP.\n\nNewbling added that the event was also integrated into the graduate architecture program. Students had their own work \u201con display,\u201d which focused on \u201cbringing life back to urban spaces.\u201d\n\nWall Street Journal reporter and panelist Peter Grant emphasized the historical significance of the broad evacuation of office space and why reuse is worth the investment. According to Grant, unlike downturns in office use in the late 1990s and late 2010s that ended up rebounding, \u201cthe downturn now is not cyclical, it\u2019s structural \u2026 this is here to stay.\u201d\n\nHowever, the panelists also discussed the complications and costs of the process of adaptive reuse. Buildings that are constructed to serve as office spaces often face fewer structural requirements than residential units \u2014 such as for included window spaces \u2014 and need expensive renovations. Grant discussed how economic factors still aren\u2019t fully allowing this process to be implemented on a large scale everywhere.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one city where you do have the necessary ingredients, and that\u2019s New York,\u201d Grant said during the event. \u201cYou have some Magic Mountain out there in New York that\u2019s producing people who are making enough money to afford $4,000 a month rents \u2014 that\u2019s not happening in a lot of these other markets.\u201d\n\nThe panelists provided examples of proposed and completed reuse projects in a wide range of cities, like Chicago, New York, Baton Rouge, La., and Providence, R.I.\n\nReina concluded that adaptive reuse is \u201ca really important piece\u201d of solving the housing crisis.\u00a0\n\n\u201cCan you actually solve our housing supply problems with these conversions? I think no,\u201d Reina said. \u201cBut you add a really important piece to our puzzle \u2014 to our many tools that we need to actually address our housing supply needs and community issues.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Pennsylvanian is an independent, student-run newspaper.
