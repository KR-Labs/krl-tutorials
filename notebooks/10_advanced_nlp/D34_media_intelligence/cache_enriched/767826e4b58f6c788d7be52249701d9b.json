Their goal: to encourage the building of more varied housing types, and by extension greater density, in the city of 156,000, with the ultimate aim of lowering overall home prices.\nIn Littleton, a similar pro-density effort had sparked a furious backlash earlier this year. Now a citizen-initiated measure is bound for the Nov. 4 ballot and, if passed, it will restrict a large chunk of the city from having anything but single-family homes \u2014 a stark pivot from city leaders\u2019 prior goal.\nEach city is part of a larger density debate that has played out in communities across metro Denver and has dominated housing affordability discussions at all levels, from the Colorado statehouse to neighborhood streets.\nLittleton City Councilwoman Andrea Peters, who is also a real estate agent, said the lack of \u201cmissing middle\u201d housing in her city is having a chain-reaction effect on younger families seeking their first home as well as older people looking to downsize. That type of housing includes duplexes, triplexes and attached townhomes, which are designed to house more people per square foot but are less imposing than hulking apartment buildings or condos.\n\u201cWe have an aging demographic and we don\u2019t have a plan for younger families,\u201d Peters said. \u201cIf we have more smaller-size options (for downsizers), that frees up that larger home for someone else.\u201d\nMark Harris, an eight-year resident of Littleton, is part of a group dubbed Rooted in Littleton that is behind Measure 3A on this fall\u2019s ballot. He says the goal is to stop the city from shoehorning certain housing types into neighborhoods where they don\u2019t fit and where residents don\u2019t want them.\nMark Harris, left, and Joe Whitney, who are leading an anti-density movement in Littleton, stand outside a newly built triplex in Littleton on Sept. 25, 2025. (Photo by RJ Sangosti/The Denver Post)\n\u201cOur intent is to preserve single-family land use \u2014 that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not anti-growth. We are not anti-affordable housing. We just don\u2019t want duplexes, triplexes and quadplexes imposed on us.\u201d\nAs high-level discussions on affordability have taken up much of the oxygen in policy debates in recent years, the issue has been tackled in the state Capitol. A collection of bills passed in 2024 and signed into law by Gov. Jared Polis was designed to increase higher-density living and bring home prices down.\nSeveral Front Range municipalities have, in turn, sued the state, claiming its mandate to implement zoning-related changes encroached on their home rule powers to set their own land-use rules.\nAnd at the center of it all is raw emotion.\n\u201cThis place doesn\u2019t resemble what it used to be \u2014 not at all,\u201d said Regina Hopkins, a lifelong Lakewood resident who feels the growth in her city over the last couple decades has been out of control. \u201cWhy are local governments being forced to fix what is a state issue?\u201d\nHopkins, 40, and others in Lakewood are exploring whether to put their own measure on the ballot to roll back what the city is expected to finalize on Oct. 13.\nBut for newcomer Robert Adams, Lakewood is doing the right thing. At 39, he finally got out of the rental game by purchasing a 1,200-square-foot, 1950s-era home in the city.\n\u201cAfter my years of renting, we bought 2\u00bd years ago \u2014 and it\u2019s quite a burden to afford a moderately-priced home,\u201d he said.\nWhile home prices have finally stagnated across metro Denver in recent months, they haven\u2019t come down much from their record levels. The median price gain of a residential property sold in August in metro Denver was 0.3% compared to the same month a year earlier, rising to $587,000, according to a recent report from Homes.com. That was below the 2.4% annual price gain seen nationally, the site said.\nIn August 2021, when values were surging, metro Denver home prices rose 17.4% compared to a year earlier.\nWhile some experts say the local housing scene has flipped to a buyer\u2019s market, high mortgage rates are keeping things tough for those on the hunt for a listing. Adams paid $650,000 for his Lakewood house, and he carries a 6.6% interest rate on his loan.\n\u201cWe can manage it, but just barely,\u201d he said.\nNeed for \u2018missing middle\u2019 housing\nThe Lakewood City Council has already approved three rounds of updates to the city\u2019s zoning code. Those include measures allowing diverse housing stock anywhere in the city, limiting new home sizes to 5,000 square feet, and encouraging the conversion of vacant or underused commercial buildings to housing.\nCouncil members will cast one last vote Oct. 13 on a final zoning map. The new rules will go into effect on Jan. 1.\n\u201cRight now, Lakewood is an infill city and there\u2019s not a lot of housing stock coming online,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThe supply and demand effect is real. The core idea of this zoning update is that it allows more units to be built \u2014 it creates more units for people who are desperately looking for a house.\u201d\nRobert Adams stands in front of his home in Lakewood on Friday, Sept. 26, 2025. (Photo by Hyoung Chang/The Denver Post)\nLakewood Mayor Wendi Strom said the overhaul had taken much of the council\u2019s time in recent months. She remembers adjourning one council meeting just before 3 a.m. in September as its members dissected and analyzed dense zoning code documents deep into the night.\nThe process, she said, isn\u2019t going to make everyone in the city happy.\n\u201cThis is their home \u2014 these are the roofs over their heads,\u201d Strom said. \u201cAnd it can be concerning what\u2019s happening on the lot next to yours.\u201d\nBut the mayor has also heard impassioned pleas from young families that just can\u2019t crack the overinflated market. Supporting the development of more housing options will help those young families as well as older residents, teachers, firefighters and first-time homebuyers, she said.\n\u201cWe have seen a level of concern from young people about the changes not being made,\u201d Strom said. \u201cRight now, we have way more demand than supply.\u201d\nAccording to the Lakewood Strategic Housing Plan, released in early 2024, planners estimated that the city would need at least 5,800 new homes built over the next 10 years to satisfy anticipated demand.\nAt the metro level, the Denver Regional Council of Governments concluded in a September 2024 report that an area encompassing slightly beyond the Denver area would need 216,000 new housing units \u2014 whether houses or apartments or other multifamily units \u2014 by 2032.\nFifty-two thousand of them would cover the current shortage, while 164,000 of that total represent new units needed in the future, DRCOG concluded.\nHouses now larger \u2014 and more expensive\nMax Nardo, a housing and smart growth senior associate with the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, said the status quo simply wasn\u2019t working. His organization has been following the Lakewood code updates closely.\n\u201cCities in Colorado are dealing with the same housing crisis, and many are looking at the same solutions \u2014 smaller homes on smaller lots,\u201d he said.\nLakewood\u2019s housing assessment report concluded that nearly three-quarters of households in the city had just one or two people. It also noted that the average single-family home built since 2000 had about 2,600 square feet of space \u2014 much larger than houses built decades earlier \u2014 and sold for more than $1.1 million.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a ridiculous mismatch with what the city really needs,\u201d Nardo said.\nA home is under construction at 6400 W. Exposition Ave. in Lakewood on Friday, Sept. 26, 2025. (Photo by Hyoung Chang/The Denver Post)\nBut Lakewood has seen at least one major institutional protest to its plans. The Green Mountain Water and Sanitation District, which serves 10,000 accounts, accounting for 48,000 residents in Lakewood, wrote a letter to the city in August. It warned that \u201cdensification\u201d of the city\u2019s housing stock could compromise the district\u2019s ability to provide adequate service.\nKaren Morgan, the district\u2019s president, told The Denver Post that the district had to plan for the long term.\n\u201cWe are already overcapacity with our sewer pipes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do not have the infrastructure to handle that density, especially since we don\u2019t know when it\u2019s happening.\u201d\nA potential harbinger of what could emerge in the wake of Lakewood\u2019s update might exist in Portland, Oregon, where city leaders undertook a similar effort to encourage denser residential construction a few years ago, Nardo said.\nA review of outcomes from that initiative found that between August 2021 and June 2024, the city permitted more than 1,400 accessory dwelling units \u2014 which typically include garage apartments and granny flats \u2014 and middle housing units, which the report described as duplexes to cottage clusters. The most common middle housing unit built during that period in Portland was a two-bedroom home weighing in at a cozy 900 square feet.\nMost notably, according to the report, the average sale price of one of those new market-rate middle housing units in 2023 and 2024 was about $250,000 less than the price of a new single-family detached house.\nAdams, the new homeowner in Lakewood, said today\u2019s housing market is far different from what it was when many homeowners who are wary about the city\u2019s initiative bought their properties.\n\u201cThey bought in at a time when it was more affordable, and they are scared that it\u2019s going to change overnight,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if they look at other places that have done this, it\u2019s a slow process.\u201d\nThat gives little comfort to folks like Hopkins, 40, who took a lead in opposing the construction of a five-story apartment complex on the edge of Belmar Park in recent years. That project, she feared, would ruin the feel of a natural oasis in the middle of Lakewood. The developer overcame that fight and is now proceeding toward construction.\n\u201cOne of the reasons I oppose the code changes is that a neighborhood\u2019s character will completely change,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to urbanize and gentrify Lakewood. They are just trying to increase density.\u201d\n\u2018All that does is gentrify\u2019\nIn Littleton, Joe Whitney says building more units won\u2019t necessarily translate to lower home prices. Prices are struck on more than just the availability of housing stock, he says. They also depend on construction costs and what is profitable for the builder.\nHe points to a recently built triplex on South Sycamore Street that offered little price relief to those looking for a home in Littleton, despite the building offering more living units than the single-family homes surrounding it. According to online records from the Arapahoe County Assessor\u2019s Office, the three attached units were purchased for between $980,000 and $1.15 million \u2014 prices well above the metro area median.\n\u201cAll that does is gentrify \u2014 it doesn\u2019t improve affordability,\u201d Whitney said of the new construction. \u201cThe last thing we want to see is Littleton turn into Lakewood.\u201d\nHousing economists and advocates for more density point out that there\u2019s more complexity at play in the housing market. They argue that the building of high-end units still reduces overall pressure on rents and housing prices as residents of lower-cost homes upgrade, moving out and making those older units available.\nBut the gentification concern is why Rooted in Littleton chose to try and preempt the city from doing what Harris called another \u201csneak attack\u201d on the city\u2019s residents. That\u2019s the term he uses to characterize the contretemps that occurred in January, when the council abandoned an attempt to welcome denser housing types in the city after blowback from the community.\nThe ballot measure, if approved by voters next month, would keep the council from bringing other types of housing to single-family neighborhoods, which Harris said cover nearly half of Littleton\u2019s land mass.\nNothing, however, would stop homeowners from requesting permission from the city to build nonconforming structures on their lot.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to tie the hands of individual property owners \u2014 we\u2019re trying to tie the hands of a City Council that just wants density,\u201d he said.\nMail ballots for Littleton\u2019s election will go out beginning Friday.\nPeters, the Littleton councilwoman, worries about the fiscal impact on Littleton if the measure ends up passing. The governor, in August, signed an executive order that threatened to withhold grants from cities that refuse to follow the new state housing laws.\nIf Littleton\u2019s hands are tied by the restrictions laid out in the ballot measure, Peters said, \u201cit means we\u2019ll be out of compliance with the state and ineligible for grant money.\u201d\nColorado Municipal League Executive Director Kevin Bommer said what\u2019s playing out today in Littleton and Lakewood strikes on a familiar theme, \u201cespecially when the pressure to grow comes head-to-head with the desire to preserve the character of a community.\u201d\nBut Bommer, a vocal opponent of state interference in municipal decisions, said \u201cthese difficult conversations are happening exactly where they are supposed to be,\u201d at the city level.\n\u201cLocal control \u2014 or local decision-making \u2014 isn\u2019t always pretty, but it is the best way to solve local challenges and talk about the future,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is precisely how things need to happen.\u201d\nGet more Colorado news by signing up for our daily Your Morning Dozen email newsletter.\nShare this:\nClick to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)\nFacebook\nClick to share on X (Opens in new window)\nX\nRevContent Feed\nEvents\nMost PopularMost PopularAsking Eric: Family punished for missing wedding 50 years laterAsking Eric: Family punished for missing wedding 50 years laterDirt likely to fly starting in 2026 on NISP water projectDirt likely to fly starting in 2026 on NISP water projectNorthern Colorado home day care owner charged with child abuseNorthern Colorado home day care owner charged with child abuseCSU quarterback Darius Curry suspended for unsportsmanlike conduct against Boise StateCSU quarterback Darius Curry suspended for unsportsmanlike conduct against Boise State\u2018Berthoud Deserves a Vote\u2019 campaign puts downtown project in jeopardy\u2018Berthoud Deserves a Vote\u2019 campaign puts downtown project in jeopardyThings to do in the Loveland area Sunday, Nov. 23: Holiday lights, Garrison KeillorThings to do in the Loveland area Sunday, Nov. 23: Holiday lights, Garrison KeillorDriver killed in westbound I-70 crash near PalisadeDriver killed in westbound I-70 crash near PalisadeYour Daily Horoscope for Sunday, November 23, 2025Your Daily Horoscope for Sunday, November 23, 2025Ellory Anne Bauersfeld selected as Miss Loveland Valentine 2026Ellory Anne Bauersfeld selected as Miss Loveland Valentine 2026RH Line calls for Sunday, Nov. 23, 2025RH Line calls for Sunday, Nov. 23, 2025", "extraction_method": "beautifulsoup", "word_count": 2562, "success": true}
