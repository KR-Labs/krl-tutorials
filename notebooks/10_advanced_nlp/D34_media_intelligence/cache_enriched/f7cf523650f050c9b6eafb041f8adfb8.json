Cultural Anthropologist on Today's Affordability and Access\n28-Oct-2025 8:00 AM EDT,\nby Wake Forest University\n\u2661\nCredit: \u00a92025 Wake Forest University\nDownload\nCredit: Sherri Lawson Clark\nPrevious\nNext\nNewswise \u2014 Is America currently in a housing crisis? Wake Forest University's Sherri Lawson Clark says individuals at all economic levels\u2014from homeless populations to middle-income homeowners are struggling with affordability.A contributor to the 2020 national report\u00a0Displaced in America, Clark\u2019s research examines the intersections of housing policy with health and welfare policies. She is developing a new housing stability measure for use throughout the U.S. in addressing housing affordability and access.Is America facing a housing crisis?Yes. As a cultural anthropologist, I am interested in the ways in which the housing crisis is experienced at the individual level. A homeless person is experiencing a housing crisis as is the middle-income homeowner whose housing costs have risen above their income. Right now, the question is not necessarily are we in a housing crisis, but are we in a place where we are likely to see the next Great Recession. I think we\u2019re at a place where we need to pay attention.How does this moment compare to the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis that led to the Great Recession?In similar ways, the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis\u00a0did not\u00a0begin in 2007; it began in the mid-1990s \u2013 taking almost a decade before the financial crisis of 2008. Today, many Americans find themselves unable to afford housing. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the average homeowner or renter should spend no more than 30% of their monthly income on housing. My research shows that individuals are spending up to half of their monthly income on housing costs. This means there is little left over in their budgets for other necessities. According to the National Housing Conference, a non-profit organization dedicated to affordable housing, two issues define America\u2019s new housing crisis: 1) skyrocketing housing costs and 2) the low rate of black homeownership, which is lower today than it was when segregation was legal.What does your research show?My current research study will shed light on the decision-making processes of homeowners and examine housing accessibility in one of East Winston-Salem, North Carolina\u2019s high-poverty census tracts. I expect the findings will greatly aid in a newly created Housing Stability measure for use throughout the U.S. (and beyond) in addressing housing affordability and access.How do housing affordability challenges differ between urban centers, suburbs and rural areas?Available housing differs across urban areas with multi-family housing, suburban areas with single-family homes, and rural areas with more manufactured housing and single-family housing. However, all these areas face housing affordability concerns, which are projected to get worse with the current changes happening at the federal level.Who\u2019s most at risk and what can be done?The most vulnerable across all areas are being displaced. Now is the time to think outside the box to develop alternatives to the traditional housing models. For example, limited equity cooperatives provide long-term affordability to residents who own shares in a development. Reducing zoning restrictions allows for more multi-family and smaller homes to be built on land zoned for single-family homes.Biography :Sherri Lawson Clark is an associate professor in the Department of Anthropology at Wake Forest University, where she has taught since 2009. An applied cultural anthropologist, she has conducted ethnographic fieldwork for more than 30 years with low-income urban and rural African American, Latino and white families across the U.S.\u00a0Clark\u2019s research focuses on housing instability among poor families and examines the intersections of housing policy with health and welfare policies, marriage initiatives, migration, and the effects of residential mobility on the well-being of poor children and families.\u00a0At Wake Forest, Clark teaches courses in cultural anthropology and social stratification in America and helps students deconstruct and comprehend conceptual arguments by applying them in real life contexts.She is co-author of \u201cPoverty Law and Advocacy in America\u201d and a contributing editor to \u201cContemporary African American Families: Achievements, Challenges, and Empowerment Strategies in the Twenty-First Century.\u201d###\u00a0About Wake Forest UniversityWake Forest University\u2019s motto, Pro Humanitate, reflects a commitment to academic excellence and to using ideas, knowledge and talents on behalf of humanity.
