Councilmember Brooke Pinto introduced a sweeping package of 23 bills Monday morning aimed at expanding economic opportunities, improving youth development programs and supporting local businesses in the District.According to Pinto, the \u201cProsper DC Plan\u201d builds on Pinto\u2019s earlier public safety-focused initiatives \u2014 Peace DC and Secure DC \u2014 by addressing what she calls the economic and opportunity gaps that contribute to instability for many residents. The plan includes measures to improve job access, reduce barriers for entrepreneurs, expand youth programming and make housing more affordable.SEE ALSO | DC invests $9.2M in program monitoring students traveling to & from school\"We must create pathways to economic prosperity for all District residents and entrepreneurs to ensure the District remains a place where people want to live, work, grow their business, and create communities that are vibrant.\u201d said Councilmember Pinto. \u201cAs I have met with residents across the District, it is clear folks are eager to be part of lifting up the city -- creating pathways to contribute, earn, and grow must be central to the future we are fighting for together. My Prosper DC Plan will help uplift families, residents, and businesses by investing in economic opportunities for residents, competitiveness for businesses, positive youth development, and affordable, healthy, and accessible communities.\u201d In weeks\u2019 worth of council hearings and testimony, saying more resources are needed to prevent kids from getting into trouble and crime, Pinto said this is her answer.WJLASeven of the 23 bills in the package focus on juveniles and their development in the district. We asked Pinto why she thinks these bills are realistic and how they relate to reducing juvenile crime.\u201cWe have to do more to prevent and if somebody violates the law they have to be held accountable,\u201d Pinto said \u201cI've always believed that we can and must do both in our city, which is why every time we advance a specific tool or specific idea it is one in a holistic set of pathways that we have to move forward in.\u201dThe bills focused on juveniles do the following:Allows minors to open a deposit account without parental consentRequires D.C. schools to create appropriate AI use for students and staffCovers 50% of wages for employers who hire a young adult parent7News asked Pinto why employers get subsidies.\u201cI'm a big believer in aligning incentives,\u201d Pinto said. \u201cWe have a population in D.C. that is seeing increased rates of teen pregnancy and young people having children, and that often creates a lot of economic challenges for that family. And so, what we wanted to create with this bill was a pilot program to provide some subsidization to get access to employment.The bills also:Gives $300,000 to non-profits for social and educational programmingRequires the Deputy Mayor for Education to create an app that connects teens looking for jobs with hiring in all eight wards. Expands the Marion Barry youth program from 24 to 30 years old.The Department of Parks and Recreation would also be required to open and operate a teen center in each quadrant of the city.Pinto said she wants this to pass and be included in this year's budget. 7News asked if the D.C. budget could handle the enhancement after the budget crisis. Pinto said it's all about focusing the budget in the right place.\"Bringing in these other aspects, this holistic approach to addressing juvenile crime, I think it makes a lot of sense as long as it\u2019s not at the expense of public safety,\" Joshua Ederheimer, a former official with the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and current assistant professor at the University of Virginia, said. Ederheimer backs the program, howeverMy only concern when I saw this was: Is money going to be diverted from the police department to support these very good programs? I think that\u2019s a very bad idea because the department is understaffed and they need the funding.The D.C. Police Union has said the department is short about 800 officers, out of a current 3,200, while the mayor says they need about 500. Enforcement, Ederheimer adds, is crucial to keeping a city safe, but it's far from the only answer. \"I think any funding for these well-thought-out programs needs to complement and be in addition to the police department budget,\" he said. According to a release, the Prosper DC Plan takes important steps to deliver:Economic Opportunities for ResidentsPositive Youth DevelopmentSupports and Attraction Incentives for BusinessesAffordable,
