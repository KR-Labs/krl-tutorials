His platform focuses on addressing the growing affordability crisis but relies heavily on increased government control, rent freezes, higher taxes, and other socialist measures, likely to exacerbate the issue.\nBy contrast, President Trump is pursuing concrete measures to address the affordability crisis, focusing on practical, results-driven policies rather than utopian proposals. He has acknowledged that affordability is an urgent concern for many Americans, especially younger voters, and is taking decisive steps to help them achieve the American Dream.\nRecommended\nShare this post\nRelated Articles\nNov 24, 2025\nFederal Judge Issues Predictable Ruling on Letitia James and James Comey\nNov 24, 2025\nThird Time\u2019s a Charm?
