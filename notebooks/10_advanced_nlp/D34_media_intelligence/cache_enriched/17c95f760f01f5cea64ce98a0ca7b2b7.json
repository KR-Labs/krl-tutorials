It highlights how many homes are needed, what types of housing are being built, and includes benchmarks for both renters and homeowners.It also features demographic insights, including household income, household size, and preferences for housing types like apartments, condos, townhomes, or single-family homes.Reno City Manager Jackie Bryant and Housing Manager Elaine Wiseman explain the tool\u2019s features in a new informational video available on the City\u2019s website and social media pages.\u201cWe\u2019re excited to launch this new housing dashboard, which gives our team a clearer, more accurate picture of Reno\u2019s housing market across all income levels and the gaps that exist,\u201d said Bryant. \u201cThis dashboard represents a significant step forward in the City\u2019s ongoing commitment to working with our partners to expand housing opportunities for the Biggest Little City.\u201dSince 2016, home prices in Reno have increased by 93 percent. According to the dashboard, at least 15,000 new homes are needed over the next 10 years, including 9,000 units considered affordable for households earning below 80 percent of the area median income.Currently, a household earning $50,000 annually can afford a monthly rent of around $1,250. The dashboard also shows a growing need for home ownership opportunities with monthly mortgages ranging from $2,500 to $3,750.The City encourages residents, housing partners, and stakeholders to explore the dashboard, which is available on the Housing and Neighborhood Development section of the City of Reno\u2019s website.\nNews Nevada Top stories\nMulti-car crash slows cars during morning commute on I-80 east in Sparks\nIncident slowing traffic on I-580 southbound near East Moana Lane\nCalmer weather with above average temps this holiday week\nFacebook\nTwitter\nWhatsApp\nSMS\nEmail\nPrint\nCopy article link\nSave\nTags\nDashboard (computing)\nSocial Issues\nEconomy\nHousing\nResidential Buildings\nPolitics\nUrban, Rural, And Regional Economics\nWatch 2 News\nMost Popular\nArticles\nVideos\nArticlesMulti-car crash slows cars during morning commute on I-80 east in SparksReno coffee shop celebrates first anniversaryOne dead, several injured in Sunday crash on U.S. 50 near Camp SacramentoWhat trends Reno shoppers are noticing while shopping for ThanksgivingPalisades Tahoe delays season openingTraffic slows on US-395 northbound near Golden Valley as crews respond to incidentMan who went missing last week found safe, Reno Police sayInvestigation underway after two cars caught fire on Kietzke LanePolice response on Bella Court leads to unexpected turn inside a Reno homeIncident slowing traffic on I-580 southbound near East Moana Lane\nVideos\nSections\nHome\nNews\nSports\nLive Stream\nWeather\nMeet The Team\nContests\nBusiness Directory\nThings 2 Do\nOnline Features\nRequest a Copy of a News Story\nServices\nPay My Bill\nFCC Public Inspection File\nFCC Applications\nKTVN Advertising Terms & Conditions\nKTVN EEO Report\nFCC Public File Help\nDo Not Sell or Share My Info\nDigital FAQ\nClosed Caption\nSearch\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nContact Information\n2News.com\n4925 Energy Way\nReno, NV 89502\nPhone: 775-858-2222\nEmail: Producers@ktvn.com\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nYouTube\nInstagram\nMobile Apps\niOS App\nAndroid App\n\u00d7\nBrowser Compatibility\nYour browser is out of date and potentially vulnerable to security risks.We recommend switching to one of the following browsers:\nMicrosoft Edge\nGoogle Chrome\nFirefox\n\u00a9 Copyright 2025\nKTVN\n4925 Energy Way,\u00a0Reno,\u00a0NV\n| Terms of Use\n| Privacy Policy\nPowered by BLOX Content Management System from BLOX Digital.\nNotifications\nSettings\nYou don't have any notifications.\nGet up-to-the-minute news sent straight to your device.\nTopics\nBreaking News\nSubscribe", "extraction_method": "beautifulsoup", "word_count": 1007, "success": true}
