And that delay is exposing a deeper problem in the housing market: hundreds of thousands of Americans who bought newly built homes over the last few years are already underwater on their mortgages.It\u2019s a trend analysts say didn\u2019t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s. (TNND)It\u2019s a trend analysts say didn\u2019t happen by accident, and the lending practices behind it mirror warning signs from the early 2000s.How Builders Helped Create a Wave of Underwater MortgagesBeing \u201cunderwater\u201d on a mortgage simply means you owe more than your home is currently worth. As Bankrate\u2019s chief financial analyst Greg McBride explains, \u201cyou owe more than the current value the asset is worth less than the amount you borrowed\u201d.But according to a new analysis first reported by The Wall Street Journal, many homeowners who purchased newly built houses in 2022\u20132024 landed in that position almost immediately. That\u2019s because large homebuilders have been offering artificially low mortgage rates, often far below market levels \u2014 in exchange for higher home prices.Here\u2019s what WSJ found, based on data from analyst John Comiskey:27% of Lennar\u2019s FHA loans from 2022\u20132024 are now underwater.18% of D.R. Horton\u2019s FHA loans are underwater.10% of Quicken Loans\u2019 FHA loans (a non-builder lender) are underwater.The playbook works like this: builders advertise mortgage rates around 3.99%, even while the broader market hovered closer to 6.3%. But to make the numbers work, they keep sale prices above what the property might otherwise be worth. Buyers get a lower monthly payment, but at the cost of taking out a loan that\u2019s already near, or above, the home\u2019s actual value.When prices stopped rising, many borrowers slid into negative equity almost immediately.What Happens When You\u2019re Underwater?For homeowners, the consequences are severe, and in some cases, financially immobilizing.You can\u2019t easily sell your home. Selling requires bringing cash to the closing table to cover the gap between the loan balance and the sale price. That can mean writing a check for tens of thousands of dollars.You can\u2019t refinance. Lenders require equity to approve a refi. Without it, homeowners are effectively locked into their existing rates.The risk of default rises. When people owe far more than their home is worth, they\u2019re more likely to walk away, a dynamic that played a major role in the 2008 housing crash, according to Bankrate.It becomes a systemic risk. Large pockets of underwater loans strain lenders, federal backstops, and local housing markets.In short, underwater mortgages trap households and can reverberate far beyond a single borrower.Is a 50-Year Mortgage a Solution, or Another Risk?Into this climate stepped former President Donald Trump, who floated a new idea on Truth Social: 50-year mortgages.Supporters call it an affordability boost. Critics are calling it a \u201clifetime mortgage.\u201dThe Upside: Lower PaymentsLower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks. (TNND)A 50-year mortgage would spread repayment over two extra decades, meaning lower monthly payments.A New York Times analysis found that on a $500,000 home, a borrower could save about $250\u2013$300 a month, around $4,000 a year, with a 50-year loan versus a standard 30-year mortgage.Lower payments could help more people qualify, especially first-time buyers who fail debt-to-income checks.The Downsides: Higher Costs and Bigger RisksThere would be enormous lifetime interest. Using the same NYT example: 30-year mortgage interest: ~$500,00050-year mortgage interest: nearly $900,000You\u2019d pay almost twice the price of the home in interest alone.The National Association of Realtors says the median age of a first-time buyer used to be 36 but is now 40. Add 50 years and they\u2019d be 86 by the time the loan matures.The Bottom LineBuilder-backed mortgages helped more Americans buy homes in a tough market, but often at the cost of pushing them into inflated prices and negative equity. Now, with underwater mortgages spreading across multiple major homebuilders, policymakers are starting to ask whether the industry\u2019s lending incentives need a closer look.Comment with BubblesBE THE FIRST TO COMMENTMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s 50-year mortgage proposal aims to boost affordability but could introduce new long-term risks: massive interest payments, slower equity, and more households vulnerable to downturns.TrendingPenn State study finds cancer cluster in 15 PA countiesA new study out of Penn State is drawing attention to a 15&ndash;county stretch of Central Pennsylvania, where melanoma rates in adults over 50 are significantly highOvernight fire destroys multiple homes in Mount CarmelFirefighters spent the early morning hours battling a devastating multi-alarm blaze that tore through a row of homes on South Poplar Street, destroying several 'Anybody can dance' Famed choreographer and dancer visits old studioFred Tallaksen has lived every dancer\u2019s dream.
