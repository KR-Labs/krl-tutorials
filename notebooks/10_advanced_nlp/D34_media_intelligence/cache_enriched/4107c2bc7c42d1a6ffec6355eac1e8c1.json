City Councilor Sharon Durkan for District 8 is working with other councilors on PLAN: Downtown to bring more affordable housing to the area. (ANNIKA MORRIS) \nThe average rent in Boston for a one-bedroom apartment is $3,452 a month, compared to the national average of $1,631 a month, according to Apartments.com The price of an average single-family home in Massachusetts increased 74% from 2016 to 2024, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. \n\u201cThe cost of housing is rising in our neighborhoods,\u201d said City Councilor Sharon Durkan, who represents district 8, which includes Boston University. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I hear from residents every day at my office hours, residents are being priced out.\u201d \n12% of Boston voters believe housing affordability is the most important issue facing the United States, according to Emerson College polling. \nDurkan said the council has been taking \u201cbold steps\u201d to allow for the development of more housing.  \nSome of the steps Durkan emphasized included amending the zoning code to make housing an allowed use in the Bullfinch Triangle, an area in Boston nestled between the West and North Ends, as well as the PLAN: Downtown initiative to bring more affordable housing to the Downtown area. \nDurkan\u2019s platform supports planning for \u201cabundance\u201d in Boston housing. \n\u201c[Abundance is] about saying yes to new people moving into the city,\u201d Durkan said. \u201cIt\u2019s about saying yes to new neighbors, and yes to making sure that our communities and the people that want to live there can stay there.\u201d  \nCity Councilor Ed Flynn said the city needs to increase the supply of affordable housing units to help address the housing crisis. \n\u201cI\u2019ve been a strong advocate for increasing affordable housing, veteran\u2019s housing [and] family-size units to help working families remain in the city,\u201d Flynn said. \nOther initiatives to allow for more housing include At-Large City Councilor Henry Santana\u2019s proposed expansion of triple decker housing. Current zoning laws limit many buildings to two and a half stories, preventing the construction of triple-deckers. \nAs another strategy to address the housing affordability crisis, Santana, along with City Councilors Benjamin Weber and Enrique Pep\u00e9n, none of whom decided to comment, sponsored a resolution in support of a rent control measure on the 2026 ballot. The initiative, filed by Homes For All Massachusetts, would reverse the statewide ban on rent control passed in 1994. \nTamara Small, CEO of NAIOP Massachusetts, an association representing the interests of the real estate industry, said rent control measures would be detrimental to the development of more housing statewide. \n\u201cWe are already getting calls from investors all over the world who have heard about this proposal, and they have said if rent control is adopted, then it\u2019s really going to kill housing production in Massachusetts,\u201d Small said.  \nCity Councilor Brian Worrell, in a city council meeting Oct. 29, proposed a plan to increase taxes on large and luxury apartment buildings and decrease tax bills for small landlords and average homeowners. \n\u201cHomeowners and small landlords are carrying a heavier load while larger apartment owners often pay less taxes per unit,\u201d Worrell said in the hearing. \nDurkan said she opposes Worrell\u2019s proposal, calling it a \u201cgut-punch at the wrong moment\u201d for housing development. \n\u201c[The proposal] really places undue burden on dense areas,\u201d Durkan said, \u201cIf we\u2019re trying to encourage housing production and density in the city of Boston \u2026 it really doesn\u2019t fit with the city\u2019s goals at the moment.\u201d \nSmall also disagreed with Worell\u2019s proposal, and said expenses would get pushed on tenants and would \u201cdramatically disincentivize any type of investment in Boston housing development.\u201d \nHilary Pizer, director of Organizing and Policy at the Massachusetts Affordable Homeownership Alliance, wrote in support of Worrell\u2019s policy in a statement to the Daily Free Press.  \n\u201cMAHA strongly supports this proposal that offers property tax relief to homeowners being squeezed by rising costs,\u201d Pizer wrote. \u201cWhen you own the home you live in, it\u2019s your shelter, and eventually your nest egg. It should be taxed at the lower residential rate.\u201d    \n \n \n \n   View Story Comments  \n \n \n \n 0    Like This Story   \n \n    Share on Facebook   \n \n    Share on X   \n \n    Email this Story   \n \n    Print this Story   \n  \n \n Leave a Comment  \n Tags:  \n\naffordable housing\nBoston City Council\nBoston municipal elections\ncity councilor benjamin weber\nCity Councilor Brian Worrell\nCity Councilor Enrique Pep\u00e9n\nCity Councilor Henry Santana\nCity Councilor Sharon Durkan\nMassachusetts Affordable Homeownership Alliance\nnaiop\nrent control  \n \n \n \n \nDonate to The Daily Free Press  \n \nYour donation will support the student journalists of Boston University.
