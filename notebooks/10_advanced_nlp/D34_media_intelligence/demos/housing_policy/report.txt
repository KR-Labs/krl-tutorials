KEY INSIGHTS
================================================================================

Regional Differences Detected:
  • Different locations show distinct coverage patterns
  • Narrative framing varies by geography
  • This spatial analysis is invisible in title-only monitoring

Value for Think Tanks:
  • Identify regional resistance patterns before policy rollout

METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

Data Source: GDELT BigQuery (Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone)
  • 758M+ global media signals
  • Real-time monitoring (15-minute update cycle)
  • 80%+ geolocated articles (vs 0% in traditional tools)
