# D03: Education

**Domain Category:** Major Socioeconomic Domain  
**Tier:** 1, 2  
**Geographic Levels:** National, State, County, School District

---

## Overview

Educational attainment, enrollment, and performance analysis using data from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and Census ACS. This domain tracks educational outcomes and their relationship to economic opportunity.

## Key Indicators

- **Educational Attainment** (EDATT) - Educational attainment by demographic group
- **Enrollment Rates** (ENROLL) - School enrollment by level
- **Educational Attainment Total** (B15003_001E) - Total population 25 years and over
- **Bachelor's Degree** (B15003_022E) - Bachelor's degree attainment

## Data Sources

### Primary Sources

1. **National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)**
   - API Endpoint: https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d21/tables/
   - API Key Required: No
   - Geographic Levels: National, State, County, School District
   - Update Frequency: Annual

2. **Census ACS**
   - API Endpoint: https://api.census.gov/data/2023/acs/acs5
   - API Key Required: Yes (CENSUS_API_KEY)
   - Geographic Levels: State, County, ZIP, Tract
   - Update Frequency: Annual

## Analysis Tiers

### Tier 1: Descriptive Analytics
- Educational attainment distributions
- Enrollment rate analysis
- Regional education comparisons

### Tier 2: Predictive Analytics
- Graduation prediction models
- Dropout risk assessment
- Educational outcome forecasting

## Recommended Models

1. **OLS Regression** (statsmodels)
   - Use case: Education determinants, attainment prediction

2. **Logistic Regression** (scikit-learn)
   - Use case: Graduation/dropout classification

3. **Multilevel Models** (statsmodels)
   - Use case: School-level effects, nested data

4. **XGBoost** (xgboost)
   - Use case: Performance prediction, feature importance

5. **Gradient Boosting** (scikit-learn)
   - Use case: Enrollment forecasting, achievement prediction

## Visualizations

- **Choropleth Map:** Educational attainment by county
- **Bar Chart:** Education level distribution
- **Box Plot:** Education metrics by region
- **Scatter Plot:** Education vs. income correlation

## Example Use Cases

1. **Educational Equity:** Identify achievement gaps across demographics
2. **Resource Allocation:** Target interventions to low-attainment areas
3. **Policy Analysis:** Evaluate education program effectiveness
4. **Workforce Development:** Match education supply with labor demand

## Getting Started

```python
from qrl_core.api.census import CensusAPI
from qrl_core.utils.api_key_manager import load_api_key
from qrl_core.models import PredictiveModel

# Load Census data
census_key = load_api_key('CENSUS_API_KEY')
census_api = CensusAPI(api_key=census_key)

education_data = census_api.get_data(
    dataset='acs/acs5',
    variables=['B15003_001E', 'B15003_022E'],
    geography='state:*',
    year=2023
)

# Build prediction model
model = PredictiveModel(type="classification")
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```
