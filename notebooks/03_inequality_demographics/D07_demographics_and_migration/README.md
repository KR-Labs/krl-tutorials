## Overview

Population demographics, migration patterns, and demographic change analysis using Census ACS and IRS migration data. Tracks population movements and demographic composition.

## Key Indicators

- **Total Population** (B01003_001E)
- **Population by Race** (B02001 series)
- **Migration Status** (B07001_001E) - Geographical mobility
- **County-to-County Migration** (IRS) - Migration flows

## Data Sources

1. **Census ACS** - https://api.census.gov/data/2023/acs/acs5
2. **IRS Migration Data** - https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-migration-data

## Recommended Models

1. **OLS Regression** - Population/migration determinants
2. **Gravity Model** - Migration flow prediction
3. **Network Analysis** - Migration network patterns
4. **Time Series Forecast** - Population projections
5. **Random Forest** - Migration classification

## Visualizations

- Choropleth: Population by county
- Network: Migration flows
- Sankey: Origin-destination migration
- Histogram: Population distribution

## Example Use Cases

- Population forecasting
- Migration pattern analysis
- Demographic change assessment
- Resource planning

## Getting Started

```python
from qrl_core.api.census import CensusAPI
import networkx as nx

census_api = CensusAPI(api_key=census_key)
pop_data = census_api.get_data(
    dataset='acs/acs5',
    variables=['B01003_001E'],
    geography='state:*',
    year=2023
)
