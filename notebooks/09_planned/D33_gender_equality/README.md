# D33: Gender Equality

**Domain Category:** Minor Socioeconomic Domain  
**Tier:** 1, 2, 4, 6  
**Geographic Levels:** State, County

---

## Overview

This domain measures gender parity in education, employment, political representation, and pay using WEF Global Gender Gap methodology adapted for U.S. subnational analysis.

## Key Indicators

- **Gender Pay Gap** - Median earnings difference (female/male), percentage
- **Female Leadership** - Share of women in state government leadership
- **Labor Force Participation by Gender** - Female vs. male participation rates

## Data Sources

### Primary Sources
1. **WEF Global Gender Gap Report (U.S. Proxy)**
   - URL: https://www.weforum.org/reports/global-gender-gap-report-2025
   - Geographic Level: State (modeled from GGGI methodology)
   - Update Frequency: Annual

2. **Census ACS Gender Employment Data**
   - URL: https://api.census.gov/data/2023/acs/acs5
   - API Key Required: Yes
   - Geographic Level: State, County
   - Update Frequency: Annual (5-year estimates)

3. **UNDP Gender Inequality Index (Benchmarking)**
   - URL: https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/thematic-composite-indices/gender-inequality-index
   - Geographic Level: National (U.S. comparison)
   - Update Frequency: Annual

### Modeling Notes
- State gender pay gap from ACS earnings data (B24010, B24020)
- Female leadership from state legislature databases
- Labor force participation from ACS (B23001)
- GGGI subindices: Economic Participation, Educational Attainment, Health & Survival, Political Empowerment

## Analysis Tiers

### Tier 1: Descriptive Analytics
- Gender pay gap distributions
- Female leadership summary statistics
- Labor force participation comparisons

### Tier 2: Predictive Analytics
- Pay gap determinants (OLS regression)
- Gender equality classification (Random Forest)
- Employment outcomes prediction

### Tier 4: Unsupervised Learning
- Clustering of high/low parity states
- PCA for gender equality dimensions
- Segmentation analysis

### Tier 6: Advanced Analytics
- Bayesian hierarchical models for regional effects
- Causal inference for policy impacts
- Difference-in-differences for equal pay legislation

## Recommended Models

1. **OLS Regression** (statsmodels)
   - Use case: Pay gap analysis & employment outcomes

2. **Random Forest** (scikit-learn)
   - Use case: Classification of high/low parity states

3. **Bayesian Hierarchical Model** (PyMC)
   - Use case: Regional gender equality modeling

## Visualizations

- **Choropleth Map:** Gender pay gap by state
- **Scatter Plot:** Labor force participation vs. political representation
- **Box Plot:** Distribution of gender pay gap
- **Bar Chart:** Female leadership by state

## Example Use Cases

1. **Pay Equity Analysis:** Measure wage gap by industry and occupation
2. **Workforce Diversity Assessment:** Track female participation in labor force
3. **Political Representation Trends:** Monitor women's representation in state legislatures
4. **Policy Impact Evaluation:** Assess equal pay legislation effectiveness

## Getting Started

```python
from qrl_core.api.census import CensusAPI
from qrl_core.models import PredictiveModel
from qrl_core.utils.plotly_visualization_engine import PlotlyVisualizationEngine
from qrl_core.utils.api_key_manager import load_api_key

# Load Census API key
census_key = load_api_key('CENSUS_API_KEY')
census_api = CensusAPI(api_key=census_key)

# Fetch gender employment data
gender_data = census_api.get_data(
    dataset='acs/acs5',
    variables=['B24010_001E', 'B24020_001E'],  # Earnings by gender
    geography='state:*',
    year=2023
)

# Analyze pay gap
model = PredictiveModel(type="regression")
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Visualize
viz_engine = PlotlyVisualizationEngine()
charts = viz_engine.generate_tier_visualizations(
    data=gender_data,
    tier_type="tier_1",
    analysis_focus="gender_equality"
)
```
