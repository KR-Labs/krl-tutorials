- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the vulnerability

## Security Best Practices for Users

### API Keys

**Never commit API keys to version control.**

Always use environment variables:

```bash
export FRED_API_KEY=your_key_here
export CENSUS_API_KEY=your_key_here
export BLS_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Or create a local configuration file (excluded from git):

```bash
# ~/.krl/apikeys
FRED_API_KEY=your_key_here
CENSUS_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Data Privacy

- Never include personally identifiable information (PII) in notebooks
- Sanitize or anonymize data before sharing
- Be cautious when publishing notebooks with real data

### Dependencies

Keep dependencies up to date:

```bash
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Use our security checks:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

This runs:
- Secret detection (gitleaks)
- Security scanning (bandit)
- Code quality checks

## Known Issues

We maintain a list of known security issues and their status in our [Security Advisory](https://github.com/KR-Labs/krl-tutorials/security/advisories) page.

## Security Tools

This repository uses:

- **gitleaks**: Secret detection in commits
- **bandit**: Python security linter
- **safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanner
- **pre-commit**: Automated security checks
